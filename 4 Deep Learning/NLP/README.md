NLP Cheat Sheet
=================================
1. Tokenization
   - Splitting text into words or subwords.
   - Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Tokenizers.
2. Embeddings
   - Convert words to vectors (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).
   - Contextual embeddings: BERT, GPT.
3. Language Models
   - Predict next word or fill in blanks (GPT, BERT).
   - Fine-tuning for specific tasks.
4. Text Classification
   - Sentiment analysis, spam detection.
   - Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Transformers.
5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Identify entities (names, dates, locations).
   - Libraries: SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers.
6. Sequence-to-Sequence Models
   - Machine translation, text summarization.
   - Models: RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers.
7. Attention Mechanism
   - Focus on relevant parts of input.
   - Key component in Transformers.
8. Transformers
   - Architecture for NLP tasks (BERT, GPT, T5).
   - Pre-trained models available via Hugging Face.
9. Evaluation Metrics
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
   - BLEU, ROUGE for text generation tasks.
10. Libraries and Frameworks
	- Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SpaCy, NLTK.
11. Deployment
	- Convert models to ONNX, TensorFlow Serving, FastAPI for serving models.
