Title: Boursin Scrambled Eggs
Category: breakfast
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/boursin-scrambled-eggs-recipe-8750323
Ingredients:
- 4largeeggs
- 3tablespoonshalf-and-half
- 1pinchsalt, plus more to taste
- 1tablespoonunsalted butter
- 2tablespoonsgarlic and fine herbs spreadable cheese (such as Boursin®), cold and crumbled
- freshlyground black pepperto taste
- chopped fresh parsley or chives, for garnish
Instructions:
1. Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and a pinch of salt together in a small bowl.
2. Melt butter in a medium nonstick pan over medium-low heat. When butter starts to bubble, pour in egg mixture. Using a silicone spatula, gently swirl the eggs around in circles from the outside in, without stopping, until you start to see small curds, about 20 to 30 seconds.
3. Switch from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger curds, about 20 seconds. When eggs are about 75% cooked, gently fold in crumbled cheese. The eggs now should be softly set and still a little runny in places.
4. Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside for about 20 to 35 seconds to allow the residual heat to finish cooking to your preferred consistency.
5. Garnish with parsley or chives, and serve immediately.Cook’s NoteLow and slow is the way to go when making scrambled eggs. Be sure to take them off the heat when they are just a bit less done than how you want to eat them. That residual heat will finish them off, so they’ll be perfectly moist and tender, not dry or overdone. Boursin comes in a variety of different flavors, so choose your favorite.

4. Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is almost melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, place toast slices together to make 2 sandwiches and pour remaining cheese sauce on top of each sandwich. Return to the broiler until sauce starts to brown, about 2 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper. Add water, cover, and baste until whites are set but yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes.
6. Top each sandwich with an egg and sprinkle with dill, if using. Serve immediately.

- 4clovesgarlic, minced
- 1teaspoonlemon zest
- 1teaspoonDijon-style mustard
- 1/2teaspoonsalt
- 1/2teaspoonred pepper flakes
- 1/2teaspoonsmoked paprika
- 1/4teaspoonfreshly groundblack pepper
- 1/4teaspooncayenne pepper
- 1teaspoonfresh thyme leaves
- 1tablespoonthinly sliced freshchives
- 2tablespoonschopped Italian parsley
- 2teaspoonslemon juice
- 2thickslicesFrench bread
- 1(8 ounce)beef filet mignon steak
- salt to taste
- 2teaspoonsavocado oil
- 1/3cupbeef bone broth
Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner or parchment paper.
2. Combine butter, garlic, lemon zest, Dijon mustard, salt, red pepper flakes, smoked paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, chives, and parsley in a bowl; mash and mix until evenly combined. Add lemon juice and mix until thoroughly incorporated.
3. Generously apply the butter to both sides of bread slices and place on the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then turn the bread over, and bake until toast is as browned and crisp around the edge as you like, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside until needed.
5. Transfer remaining butter onto a piece of plastic wrap, and shape into a 2-inch diameter cylinder. Refrigerated until needed, then slice into medallions for serving.
6. Turn the steak on its side, and slice down the middle, cutting the filet into 2 equal sized 4-ounce portions. Season both sides with salt.
7. Place a skillet over high heat, and add avocado oil. Once the oil is shimmering, sear steaks for about 2 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked to your desired doneness. Turn off the heat, and transfer the steaks on your plate to rest for 3 to 4 minutes, while you deglaze the pan.
8. To deglaze pan, add beef broth into the still-hot pan, and scrape the bottom with a spoon or spatula to release any caramelized bits. There should be enough heat in the pan to reduce the liquid down to about 2 tablespoons, but if not, turn the heat to medium-high until reduced.
9. Place steak on toast, and drizzle over the pan drippings. Top with a slice of cowboy butter, and enjoy.John Mitzewich

Title: Grilled Tomahawk Steak
Category: dinner
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/grilled-tomahawk-steak-recipe-7508957
Ingredients:
- 1tablespoonbrown sugar
- 1tablespoonMontreal steak seasoning
- 2teaspoonsgarlic powder
- 2teaspoonsonion powder
- 1(2 ¾ pound)tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)
- 1/4cupsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1tablespoonminced shallot
- 1clovegarlic, minced
- 1tablespoonchopped fresh chives
- 2teaspoonsreserved steak rub
Instructions:
1. To make the steak rub: Place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir to combine. Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.
2. Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides with remaining steak rub until well coated. Place steak, uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.
3. To make the compound butter: Mash butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl with a fork until evenly combined. Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
4. Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining.
5. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an instant-read thermometer. If you are using a digital meat thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
6. Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes.
7. During the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
8. When steak reaches an internal temperature of  110 degrees F (43 degrees C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from the oven.
9. Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame flare-ups. The internal temperature should now read 125 to 135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare.
10. Remove steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top. Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic, shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes.
11. Slice steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter. Be sure to serve the bone–someone will want to gnaw on it!

Title: Prosciutto Melon Granita
Category: dessert
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/prosciutto-melon-granita-recipe-11793630
Ingredients:
- 3ouncesprosciutto
- 2poundsripe sweetmelon, any type
- 1/3cupwater
- 1/8teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/4cupplus 1 teaspoonwhite sugar, divided
- 2dropsgreen gelfood coloring, or as needed
Instructions:
1. Tear prosciutto into thin strips, and transfer into a dry nonstick sauté pan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until fat begins to render out and meat begins to brown slightly at the edges, just a few minutes. Remove 2/3 of prosciutto to a plate and reserve; this will be used later for the melon granita mixture.
2. Continue to cook the remaining 1/3 of meat until rendered further and edges begin to crisp, about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer meat onto a paper towel-lined plate, and let cool. Chop into small pieces when cool enough to handle, and refrigerate until needed. Do not wipe any fat from the pan.
3. Scoop 2 pounds of ripe, sweet melon into a bowl. Transfer 8 ounces of melon from the bowl into a blender. Place the bowl with remaining melon into the refrigerator until needed.
4. Add reserved 2/3 portion of prosciutto into the blender. Add 1/3 cup of water, and blend until smooth.
5. Pour melon mixture into the same sauté pan you cooked prosciutto in; add a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl, pour in melon mixture, and gently press out the liquid. Cool down to room temperature before proceeding, about 15 minutes. Refrigerate, if desired, for faster cooling.
6. Liquify remaining 1 1/2 pounds melon in the blender; add to the bowl with prosciutto-infused melon. Add a drop or two of green food coloring, and stir to combine.Chef's NoteThe final granita will be about half as dark in color as the liquid is before freezing. For a final light melon-green color, use enough food coloring to create at least a medium green liquid.
7. Pour melon mixture into a casserole dish. Ideally, liquid should be about 1/2-inch deep.
8. Transfer the casserole into the freezer, uncovered, until the outside edge begins to freeze, 30 to 45 minutes. Use a fork to mix the partially frozen portion into the liquid portion and stir to combine. Freeze for about 30 minutes, and repeat. Continue freezing and scraping with a fork as many times as it takes to create the texture of slightly wet snow. Cover and freeze until ready to serve.
9. For candied prosciutto bits, add reserved chopped prosciutto to a dry nonstick sauté pan over medium heat, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Cook, stirring, until sugar disappears, and prosciutto pieces become shiny. Transfer onto a plate and let cool. Prosciutto pieces should be crispy when cool.
10. To serve, use a fork to break up the granita into crystals, as fine or coarse as you like. Sprinkle  with candied prosciutto bits.John Mitzewich

- 1/2cupdark chocolate chips
- 1/3cupchoppedroasted salted peanuts
- 1 1/2cupsvanilla ice cream
Instructions:
1. Place 4 jars in the freezer.
2. Use a serrated knife to score around the bottom of the sugar cones, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches from the tip. Snap the tip off, and reserve.
3. Break or smash the rest of the cones into small pieces; transfer into a bowl.
4. Use the bottom of the Mason jar to trace 12 circles on a piece of parchment paper. Turn the paper over before using.
5. Add chocolate chips to a microwave-safe bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons to a smaller bowl and reserve.
6. Microwave chocolate chips for 30 seconds, then stir and continue to microwave, 10 to 15 seconds at a time, until chocolate is hot and will liquefy when stirred. Stir in reserved chocolate chips, and continue to stir until completely melted.
7. Transfer at least 1 rounded teaspoon chocolate into the center of each circle on the parchment, and spread evenly to the outline. Dip the base of each reserved cone tip into chocolate; set each one upright in the center of 1 of the chocolate circles.
8. Sprinkle chopped peanuts onto the exposed chocolate of all 12 circles. Let sit until completely cooled and firm, 30 to 60 minutes.
9. Spoon remaining melted chocolate over the bowl of crushed cones and stir to coat. Spread out in a single layer on a piece of parchment; let cool until firm.
10. To assemble each jar, make 2 layers of ice cream, cone pieces, and peanut chocolate circles, filling the jar about 2/3 full. Add a top layer of ice cream, filling nearly to the rim of the jar; top with a chocolate peanut circle containing a cone.
11. As each jar is assembled, transfer quickly into the freezer. Cover loosely and let freeze for 1 hour before serving for best results.John MitzewichChef's NoteChocolate circles and chocolate-coated cone pieces will harden faster in the refrigerator if you’re in a hurry.

3. Portion the cookies: divide and roll the dough into 12 balls, about 60grams each, or 3 leveled tablespoons. If using extra chopped white chocolate, press several pieces into each dough ball and place them in the refrigerator.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheet. You can fit 6 to 8 on a half sheet, leaving some space for spreading between each.
6. Bake until cookies have spread and centers no longer look shiny and wet, 13 to 14 minutes. Bang the pan carefully on the counter 1 or 2 times to flatten cookies a bit, giving them chewier centers. Let cool on the pan. Enjoy!Peyton Beckwith
7. Cook’s NoteIt’s important that the dough chills a minimum of 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to get the best texture. Without adequate chill time, the cookies will spread more and not be as thick as they should be.You can also pop the dough in the freezer for about 30 minutes to expedite—flip it over once for even chilling.You don’t have to bake these all at once— bake some the next day and you will see how the texture changes as the flour is fully hydrated.

- 2tablespoonswhite sugar
- 1/8teaspoongroundcinnamon
- 2tablespoonsvegetable shortening
- 1largeegg
- 1/4cupMarsala wine
- 1tablespoonwater,plus more as needed
- 2teaspoonsdistilledwhite vinegar
- 2tablespoonsbutter
- 4largeGranny Smith apples, peeled and diced
- 1cup packedbrown sugar
- 2teaspoonsapple pie spice
- 1/4teaspoonsalt
- 1/4cuplemon juice
- 1/4cupcornstarch
- 1(16 ounce) tubwhole milk ricotta cheese,drained (see "Draining Ricotta," below)
- 1/4cupconfectioner's sugar,plus more for garnish
- 1teaspoonlemon zest
- 1largeegg white,lightly beaten
- 1quartvegetable oil for frying,or as needed
Instructions:
1. For dough, stir together flour, white sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Make a well in the center.
2. Add egg, Marsala, water, and vinegar to well. Mix with a fork until dough starts to come together. Transfer to a flour-dusted work surface; knead until dough forms a ball, about 10 minutes, adding 1 teaspoon water as needed. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight).
3. For apple filling, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add apples, brown sugar, apple pie spice, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft, about 15 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together lemon juice and cornstarch; add to apple mixture. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer cooled mixture to a pastry bag.
4. For ricotta filling, stir together drained ricotta and powdered sugar in a large bowl; fold in lemon zest. Transfer mixture to a pastry bag.
5. To shape and fry shells, divide dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 ball into a 16- to 18-inch circle, about 1/16 inch thick or less. Using a 4- to 5-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 12 circles. Dust circles with a light coating of flour. (This will help you later in removing shells from cannoli tube molds.) Roll each dough circle around a cannoli tube, sealing edges with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining dough ball.
6. Pour oil to a depth of 3 inches in a deep, heavy-bottomed 4-quart pot or deep fryer; heat to 375°F. (You’ll need about 1 quart oil.) Working in batches, fry shells on tubes, turning halfway through, until golden, about 1 minute. Using tongs, transfer shells to a wire rack lined with paper towels to drain.
7. Let stand just until tubes are cool enough to handle, then carefully twist each tube to remove shell. (Using a kitchen towel may help your grip.) Wash or wipe off tubes to use for remaining shells, if needed.
8. To assemble, pipe apple filling into shells, filling two-thirds full from center to one end and repeating on other side. Repeat piping method with ricotta filling. Garnish cannoli with powdered sugar.Draining RicottaTo drain ricotta, place a cheesecloth- lined fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Place ricotta in strainer, cover with plastic wrap, then place a heavy object (like an unopened 28-oz. can) on top. Put all components in the refrigerator and drain at least 8 hours (and up to 24 hours). Discard any liquid before using in Step 4.Cook’s NoteMake Ahead: Store unfilled shells in an airtight container up to 1 month. Chill apple and ricotta fillings in separate airtight containers up to 3 days. Fill shells no more than 1 hour before serving.From the EditorWe have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking.

- 1/2teaspoonlemon juice
- 8ouncesmascarpone cheese,chilled
- 4ouncescream cheese, chilled
- 3cupsheavy whipping cream, chilled
- 1 1/2cupspowdered sugar, or to taste

- 1/2cupfreshraspberries, rinsed and dried, plus more for garnish
- 1/2cupfresh blueberries, rinsed and dried, plus more for garnish
- 1/2cupfresh strawberries, rinsed and dried, plus more for garnish
Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and line 3 (8 inch) round cake pans with parchment paper; grease the parchment.
2. Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, eggs, sour cream, oil, vanilla, and almond extract until completely smooth and combined. Add in the dry ingredients and whisk until mostly incorporated. Add in milk, and whisk until batter is mostly smooth. Batter will be runny.
4. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out mostly clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
6. To make jam syrup, mix together jam, water, and lemon juice in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir until mixture is thoroughly combined. Brush jam syrup evenly over the top of cooled cakes.
7. To make chantilly cream, beat together mascarpone and cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Add in heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt. Beginning on low speed and gradually increasing to medium high, beat mixture until it holds stiff peaks. Do not overbeat, or cream will curdle.
8. To assemble, place 1 cake layer onto a plate or platter. Top with a hefty dollop of chantilly cream and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle 1/2 of berries over the top of the cream and gently press into the cream. Top with second cake layer, and repeat adding cream and berries. Top with the final cake layer. Cover top and sides of cake with remaining cream.
9. Arrange remaining berries on top of cake as desired. Place cake into the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours before serving.

1. Place half-and-half in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until mixture just begins to simmer, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often. Remove pan from heat and add in chai tea bags. Allow mixture to steep, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.

Title: My Mum's Cranberry Summer Pudding Is the Star of Our Holiday
Category: dessert
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/mum-s-summer-pudding-recipe-11811313
Ingredients:
- 6ouncescranberries, fresh or frozen
- 1/4cupdarkmaple syrup
- 1/4cupwhitesugar
- 1/4cupwater
- 12ouncesfrozenberry mix
- 8ouncesfreshblackberries(optional)
- 8sliceswhite bread, crusts removed, or more as needed
- 1cupheavy cream
- 2tablespoonsdarkmaple syrup
- 1/4teaspoonground ginger
- 1pinchsalt
- pomegranate seeds,for garnish (optional)
Instructions:
1. Line a 7 to 8-inch pudding bowl with plastic wrap so there is overhang on all sides. Set aside.
2. Add cranberries, 1/4 cup maple syrup, sugar, and water to a saucepan, set over medium heat, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, then add frozen berries and blackberries. Keep the heat on low to medium until all the fruit is soft and you have lots of juice in the pan, about 10 minutes more.
3. Strain juice into a large bowl. Set fruit aside.
4. If you’re in a rush here and need the dessert to be ready in under 4 hours, check the footnotes  before the next step.
5. Dip 1 side of bread in fruit juices for 2 seconds and start lining the bowl with dipped slices, with some overlap, and the dipped side facing out.
6. Once the entire bowl is covered with bread - you don’t want any gaps! - pour in the fruit and cover the top of the bowl with a couple more dipped bread slices. Wrap the plastic wrap overhang over the top and place a plate with something heavy on top of the bowl. Place in the fridge for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours to set.
7. Just before serving, whip cream with 2 tablespoons maple syrup, ground ginger, and a pinch of salt. Turn the bowl out onto a serving dish, and use plastic wrap to ease the pudding  out of the dish. It should be a bright pink dome. Cut slices from the dome and serve with whipped cream, and any extra juice you have left. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds for garnish.Peyton BeckwithCook’s NoteIf you are hoping to chill for only 4 hours, dip both sides of the bread, 1 second each side.If you prefer a cinnamon whipped cream, just switch the ground ginger out for the same amount  of cinnamon.

Transfer dough to a lightly greased bowl, turning to coat. Chill, covered, until dough is easy to handle, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
3. Grease 2 (9 inch) round cake pans or 2 (8 inch) square baking pans. Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside. Punch down dough. Divide dough in half. Roll one portion of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 6x16-inch rectangle. If dough springs back when rolling, cover and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then try rolling again. Spread 1/3 cup caramel sauce over rolled-out dough portion; sprinkle with half the cinnamon-sugar and apples.
4. Starting on a long side, roll up dough to form a log; pinch seam to seal. Slice dough log into 8 (2-inch-thick) pieces. Put rolls, cut sides down, in one of the prepared pans. Repeat with remaining dough, 1/3 cup caramel sauce, cinnamon-sugar, and apples. Let rolls rise, covered, in a warm place until nearly double in size, about 30 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Drizzle rolls with 1/2 cup caramel sauce and serve warm.Make 'Em MiniPrepare as directed, except in Step 4, slice each dough log into 16 (1-inch-thick) pieces. Bake rolls until golden brown, 17 to 22 minutes. Cool and serve as directed.Recipe TipIf you like, substitute 2 (1 pound) packages frozen bread dough, thawed, for the homemade dough and skip ahead to Step 3.

- 6lemons, organic preferred,or more as needed (you may need as many as 10 lemons)

1. Combine strawberries, blueberries, and 1/2 of the sugar in a bowl. Use a potato masher to lightly crush berries until all blueberries have broken open.
2. Use a sharp vegetable peeler to peel off just the yellow zest from 6 lemons; add lemon zest to the berry-sugar mixture.
3. Pour remaining sugar into the bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and let sit on the counter for 2 to 6 hours, stirring occasionally, or refrigerate overnight if you prefer.
4. Bring 5 cups water to boil in a saucepan, transfer in berry mixture. Immediately turn off heat, and let sit for 5 minutes, stirring a few times.

6. Cut the 6 zested lemons in half, and squeeze the juice (through a strainer to catch the seeds) into the bowl.
7. Taste, and juice in more lemons as desired. You will have another chance to adjust the final flavor after the lemonade is cold.

Title: Pissaladière (Southern French “Pizza”)
Category: snacks
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/pissaladiere-southern-french-pizza-recipe-11787803
Ingredients:
- 1 1/4cupswater
- 1teaspoondry active "rapid rise" yeast
- 1tablespoonolive oil, plus more for greasing parchment
- 3cupsall-purpose flour
- 1 1/2teaspoonskosher salt
- 4ouncesolive oil-packed anchovy filets
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 4tablespoonsunsalted butter
- 5largeyellow onions- peeled, halved, and thinly sliced
- 1/2teaspoonkosher salt
- 6fresh thymesprigs
- 2tablespoonssherry vinegar
- 1/4teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 20pittedKalamata or Nicoiseolives, rinsed well, halved lengthwise
- finely chopped chives,for garnish (optional)
Instructions:
1. For dough, add water and yeast to a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes. Stir in olive oil, flour, and salt, and knead until a very sticky, elastic dough is formed, about 4 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
2. Punch down dough to remove the air bubbles, and transfer to a floured work surface. Form into a smooth ball of dough.
3. Grease a parchment paper sheet with olive oil; and transfer dough onto the sheet; grease another parchment sheet and lay it on top of the dough. Press out dough with your hands to form a rectangle, then switch to a rolling pin and roll dough out to cover nearly the entire surface of the paper.
4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Transfer dough with both sheets of parchment onto a sheet pan. Carefully peel off the top sheet of paper, and then use a fork to prick the dough all over.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove to cool on a rack; set aside until needed.
6. Transfer anchovies into a bowl and cover with 4 cups of cold water. Gently separate the fillets and let soak for 1 hour. Water may be changed halfway through to remove more salt from anchovies. Drain and pat dry on paper towels.
7. For caramelized onions, add butter and olive oil to a heavy-bottomed pot, and place over medium-high heat. Add onions and salt, and toss occasionally with a spatula, until onions just begin to slump down in the pot. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.
8. Uncover; reduce heat to medium low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are a light golden brown, about 1 hour. Add thyme, sherry vinegar, and black pepper. For a slightly more intense version, a few anchovy fillets can be added to the onions at this point. Cook, stirring, for another 10 to 15 minutes. Turn off heat and let cool.
9. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C).
10. Line a baking sheet with a fresh sheet of parchment, and grease with olive oil. Place crust on the prepared sheet. For a crispier edge, brush 1-inch of the outside edge of dough with olive oil. Spread caramelized onions over crust, going nearly to the edge.
11. Place half of the anchovies in diagonal rows, spaced a couple inches apart, on top of the onions, then place the other half of anchovies in diagonal rows in the other direction to form the classic pissaladiere decoration. Place an olive half inside each opening in the grid formed by anchovies.
12. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of the crust are browned, and the bottom is golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to ool for about 5 minutes. Cut in squares and serve.John MitzewichChef's NotePie crust dough or frozen puff pastry can also be used for this, following the same procedure.Fresh marinated anchovies, also known as boquerones, can also be used instead of olive oil-packed anchovies.

Title: Churrasco Chicken
Category: mexican
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/churrasco-chicken-recipe-11728915
Ingredients:
- 8chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on
- 4clovesgarlic, peeled and sliced
- 1Fresno chili pepperor other hot pepper, seeded and sliced
- 1teaspooncoarsesea salt
- 2lemons, zested
- 1 1/2teaspoonsdried oregano
- 2 1/2teaspoonspaprika
- 1 1/2teaspoonsground cumin
- 3tablespoonsred wine vinegar
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 1lemon, juiced
- 2teaspoonskosher salt, or to taste
- lemon wedges(optional)
Instructions:
1. Make 2 very shallow cuts into the skin of the chicken thigh, perpendicular to the bone, about 1 inch apart, going through the skin, but not down to the bone.
2. Flip thighs over, and make a cut directly on top of the bone in the same direction from one end to the other. Use a tip of the knife to trim on either side of the bone until you can slide your fingers underneath. Slide the knife underneath the bone, and cut toward both ends to remove the bone. Trim off any cartilage that remains.
3. Place the prepped thighs into a resealable plastic bag set in a bowl.
4. Add garlic, chili pepper, and sea salt to a mortar, and use the pestle to crush the mixture into a coarse paste.
5. Add lemon zest, oregano, paprika, and cumin, and continue crushing and smashing until a relatively smooth paste is formed, about another minute.
6. Add lemon juice, wine vinegar, and olive oil, and stir with the pestle until everything is emulsified.
7. Transfer marinade into the bag of chicken thighs, along with the extra salt (1 teaspoon of salt per pound of meat is a good rule of thumb). Use tongs to mix very thoroughly. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag tightly.
8. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Chicken can be grilled after marinating just 2 or 3 hours, but overnight is much better.
9. Prepare a charcoal grill until coals are hot, white, and ashy. Place the chicken skin side down over hot charcoal, and let it cook for 2 minutes. Turn chicken over, and cook the meat side for about 5 minutes.
10. Turn chicken back over to the skin side, and continue cooking until skin is nicely browned and lightly charred in spots. If the chicken still needs to cook longer, but this skin is getting too dark, flip it back over to the meat side and continue grilling until the chicken is done. An instant read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
11. Remove chicken to a serving platter, and pour over any accumulated juices. Serve with fresh lemon wedgesJohn MitzewichChef's NoteThis recipe can be made without removing bones from chicken, but cooking time will be much longer.For a spicier version, habanero or serrano chilies can be used.You can double the marinade ingredients, and save half to be used as a sauce on the finished dish.Serve with ourChimichurri Potato Salad.

2. Meanwhile, heat oil over medium heat in a large pan. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until they break down, about 5 minutes. Let the mixture cool.
3. Place peppercorns, cloves, dried ginger, cumin seeds, thyme, marjoram, and oregano in a mortar and grind into a fine mix.
4. In a blender, combine soaked chilies, 1/4 cup of the chile soaking liquid, onion-tomato mix, ground spices, chicken bouillon, and apple cider vinegar. Blend until smooth. Add a small amount of beef broth if needed for blending. Taste sauce; season with salt.
5. To cook meat, place chuck roast, beef shanks, and beef short ribs in a large pot and pour the sauce over it. Add enough beef broth to cover meat by about 1 inch, then stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat, then add cinnamon stick, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Cover, and reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is tender and falling apart, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove and discard short rib bones; skim fat from surface of broth using a spoon. Reserve fat for another use, such as quesabirrias. Taste broth; season with salt.
6. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add ramen, and cook until tender, 7 to 20 minutes, or according to package instructions. Drain; divide noodles into bowls.

Title: Campfire Carnitas
Category: mexican
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/campfire-carnitas-recipe-11768049
Ingredients:
- 4poundsbonelesspork shoulder
- 4teaspoonskosher salt,or 1 teaspoon per pound of meat
- 1teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1/2teaspoonMexicanoregano
- 1white onion,sliced
- 1Fresnochili pepper,seeded and halved, or more to taste
- 6garlic cloves,skin on
Instructions:
1. Cut pork into 2-inch pieces. Stack 2 (7x10x3-inch) disposable foil baking pans and transfer in the pork. Season with salt, pepper, and oregano, and toss with your hands until everything is evenly coated.
2. Cover the pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and crimp tightly around the edges. Place on top of another large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and then wrap the foil up over the pan. All seams should be rolled facing up. Repeat with 2 more sheets of aluminum foil.
3. Place pan next to a campfire, or in a charcoal grill, and arrange the burning coals evenly around the pan. Wrap a sheet pan in foil, place over the pan, and arrange some charcoal on top.
4. Use a probe or laser thermometer to check the temperature on the surface of the bottom pan, as well as the ambient temperature next to the pan. Try to maintain a constant temperature of between 250 to 300 degrees F (120 to 150 degrees C). To do this, move charcoal further away or closer to the pan as needed. If cooking next to a campfire and the pan is getting more heat from one direction than the other, rotate the pan occasionally. Cook until falling-apart tender, 4 to 5 hours.Chef's NotesIf cooked at the higher end of the temperature range, pork will be ready in about 4 hours. Cooking at the lower end of the range will probably take 5 hours. Move the pan occasionally, so that it does not remain over or too near the hottest part of the fire—if the oil overheats it can leak out and cause flare ups. Anytime the pan is getting too hot, simply pull it away from the fire. Use long metal tongs and heatproof gloves when working with the pork and the fire.If using a grill, keep the pan covered, and use grill vents to adjust temperature.To safely check doneness, always remove pan to a safe location before opening the foil.
5. Remove pan from the fire, and let rest for up to 1 hour, or serve immediately. Carefully cut foil away and peel back. Serve made into tacos, nachos, or enjoyed in hot dog or hamburger buns.John Mitzewich

- 1tablespoonNew Mexico or regularchili powder
- 1teaspoongroundchipotle
- 1teaspoonground cinnamon
- 3 1/2teaspoonskosher salt(1 teaspoon kosher salt per pound of meat)
- 1tablespoonwhite vinegar
- 4clovesgarlic, peeled

- 1tablespoonolive oil, plus more as needed
- 1yellow onion, halved and sliced
- 1teaspoonground cumin
- 1teaspoondried Mexicanoregano
- 1/3cupwater or chicken broth
- 1/2cupfinely diced white oryellow onion
- 1/2cupfinely dicedfresh or canned pineapple
- 1tablespoonfinely slicedfresh oregano leaves
- 1/4teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/2lime, juiced, or to taste
- cayenne for garnish
Instructions:
1. Place chops in a resealable plastic bag set in a bowl. Add pineapple, guajillo, New Mexico chili powder, chipotle, cinnamon, salt, white vinegar, garlic, and onions to the jar of a blender, and blend until marinade is smooth; pour marinade into bag. Massage pork to coat evenly. Press out air, seal the bag, and refrigerate overnight, or up to 48 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
3. Heat olive oil in an oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Remove chops from marinade, scraping off as much excess as possible; reserve all marinade for the sauce. Sear chops in the hot pan on both sides until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate; set aside.
4. Add yellow onion, cumin, and dried oregano to the pan, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. If pan seems dry, add another drizzle of oil.
5. Turn off heat, and pour in water. Stir, scraping any brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Place chops on top of onion mixture.
6. Roast in the preheated oven until pork is cooked to taste, 20 to 30 minutes, basting or brushing chops with pan juices occasionally. An internal temperature of 140 to 145 degrees F (60 to 63 degrees C) will ensure juicy, tender meat. Roasting time will vary greatly depending on size of chops, so check temperature with an instant-read thermometer early and often.
7. Meanwhile, pour marinade into a saucepan, and add about 1/2 cup of water, or as needed to achieve desired thickness. Bring to a simmer on medium-high heat, whisking occasionally. Taste sauce for seasoning; keep warm until needed.
8. To make salsa, combine white onion, diced pineapple, fresh oregano, ¼ teaspoon salt, and lime juice in a bowl and mix thoroughly.
9. Remove pork from the oven; tent with foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. While resting, tops of chops can be garnished with sauce and a spoon of salsa.John MitzewichChef's Note:If using thinner, regular pork chops, the roasting steps may not be necessary. Simply pan-fry until desired doneness is reached, and remove to a plate. While resting, make onion mixture, but cook longer over medium heat, until onions are soft and sweet.

Title: Pizza Focaccia
Category: italian
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/pizza-focaccia-recipe-11691464
Ingredients:
- 2cupslukewarmwater
- 1(0.25 ounce) packetactive-dry yeast(I prefer Red Star®)
- 1/2teaspoonsugar
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 1tablespoonkosher salt
- 3cupsall-purpose flour
- 2cupsbread flour
- olive oil, as needed
- 1cupshredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese
- 1cupmarinara sauce
- 1/2cupshredded Parmesan cheese
- 1/4cupmini pepperoni slices(Optional)
Instructions:
1. For the focaccia:Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
2. Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.
3. Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.
4. After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let rise for 30 minutes.
5. At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.
6. For the toppings:Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
7. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
8. After focaccia is risen, lightly drizzle the surface with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter mozzarella cheese in an even layer.
9. Use a spoon to dollop the surface with marinara, then sprinkle the top with Parmesan cheese. Top with pepperoni.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until focaccia and cheeses are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

- 1/2teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1pinchcayenne pepper
- 1/2teaspoondried thyme
- 1/2teaspoondried rosemary
- 1/2teaspoondried oregano
- 1yellow onion, sliced
- 4clovesgarlic,minced
- 1tablespooncapers
- 1anchovy filet
- 1cupwhite wine
- 2cupscrushed tomatoes or tomato sauce
- 1/2cupwater
- 1teaspoonchicken bouillon paste
- 3red ororange bell peppers, seeded and cut into 3/8-inch strips
- 3slicesprosciutto, cut into strips
- chopped Italian parsley (optional)
Instructions:
1. Use a sharp knife to make 2 cuts through the skin in the center of the thigh, down to the bone, about one inch apart from each other. Once cut, transfer thighs into a mixing bowl.
2. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil, and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne, and dried herbs. Use tongs to toss until very thoroughly coated. Wrap and refrigerate chicken for at least 2 hours, or up to 12 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
4. Heat remaining olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook until a deep golden brown crust has formed, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook for 3 minutes more. Turn off heat, remove chicken to a plate, and set aside.
5. Turn heat back on to medium, and add onions. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes or until the onions just begin to soften. Make a space in the center of the pan, and add garlic, capers, and anchovy. Cook for about 1 minute, while stirring and smashing with the edge of a wooden spoon or spatula.
6. Pour in wine, and raise the heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes until the wine reduces by about half. Add tomatoes, water, and chicken bouillon paste; stir to combine. Return mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces slightly, 3 to 4 minutes.
7. Add sliced peppers, and mix in evenly. Scatter about 3/4 of prosciutto slices evenly over the top. Place chicken thighs back on top, spaced evenly, skin side up. Place remaining prosciutto slices between chicken pieces.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through and the top is nicely browned, 40 to 45 minutes.
9. Top with parsley and serve immediately on olive oil mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta.John Mitzewich

Title: Loaded Potato Focaccia
Category: italian
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/loaded-potato-focaccia-recipe-11690909
Ingredients:
- 2cupslukewarmwater
- 1(0.25 ounce) packetactive-dry yeast, such asRed Star®
- 1/2teaspoonsugar
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 1tablespoonkosher salt
- 3cupsall-purpose flour
- 2cupsbread flour
- olive oil, as needed
- 1Yukon gold potato, thinly sliced on a mandoline
- kosher salt, to taste
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1cupshreddedsharp Cheddar cheese
- 4slicesbacon, cooked and crumbled
- 2scallions, thinly sliced
Instructions:
1. For the focaccia: Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
2. Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.
3. Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.
4. After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes.
5. At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.
6. For the toppings:Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
7. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
8. Once focaccia has risen for an hour, drizzle the surface with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter cheese in an even layer. Dimple the surface again, then layer the potato slices on top. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with crumbled bacon.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until the focaccia and cheese are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.
10. Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes, then sprinkle sliced scallions all over before slicing and serving.

- 2tablespoonsunsalted butter
- 2yellow onions, cut into half moons
- kosher salt, to taste
- 1cupgrated Gruyère cheese
- 1/2teaspoonherbes de Provence or dried thyme
Instructions:
1. For the focaccia:Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
2. Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.

4. After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes.
5. At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.
6. For the toppings:Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
7. Meanwhile, melt butter in a light-colored skillet over medium heat. Add onions and a generous pinch of salt and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often until onions are deeply caramelized, about 40 minutes. As the onions cook, you may need to add water, 1/4 cup at a time, to keep the onions from burning. After 40 minutes, onions should be deeply browned and jammy in consistency. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.
8. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
9. Lightly drizzle the surface of the focaccia with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter Gruyère cheese in an even layer. Dimple the surface again, then dollop onions all over the surface. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until the focaccia and cheese are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Title: Roman-Style Pizza
Category: italian
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/roman-style-pizza-recipe-8771243
Ingredients:
- 4 1/4cupsbread flour (500 grams)
- 1rounded teaspoondry yeast (3.5 grams)
- 1 1/2cupsplus 3 tablespoonswater (400 ml)
- generous1 1/2tablespoonsolive oil(20 ml), plus 2 teaspoons more to oil container
- rounded 1 1/2 teaspoonssea salt or kosher salt (10 grams)
- 6ouncesItalian sausage
- 1cupdiced sweetpeppers and onions
- 1 1/2cupspreparedpizza sauce
- 2cupsshredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 1/2cupsshredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 1/2cup freshly gratedParmigiano Reggiano cheese
- 1/4cupolive oil, divided
Instructions:
1. For dough, mix together flour, yeast, and water with a wooden spoon until almost all flour has disappeared and a rough dough is formed.
2. Add salt and olive oil and continue mixing with a spoon for about 3 minutes until a smooth, very soft and sticky dough forms. Clean off spoon and scrape down bowl. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.
3. Perform first set of rotating folds: leaving dough in the bowl, with a damp hand, reach under and grab the dough at the edge of the bowl, pull it and stretch it over the top. Rotate the bowl a few inches and repeat about 10 or 12 times, then gather the dough into a ball as best you can, turning the smoothest side up. Cover the bowl, and let dough rest for 15 minutes. Repeat this stretch, fold, and rest process 2 more times.
4. Transfer dough into an oiled container with a lid, rub dough with a few drops of olive oil and cover. Refrigerate for 24 hours or until doubled in size.
5. Transfer dough to the counter. With damp hands press and stretch dough into a square about 15 inches wide. Fold in half, and then in half again to create a rectangle. Fold rectangle into thirds, and turn over so the seam side is down.
6. Shape back into a neat ball with damp hand. Transfer dough into an oiled container, rub with a few drops of olive oil, and cover. Refrigerate for an additional 24 hours or until doubled in size.
7. Remove dough from the refrigerator and let stand on the counter for 1 hour to come to room temperature.
8. Meanwhile, prepare toppings: Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, breaking up any clumps with a spatula, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan; set aside to cool. Add red peppers and onions to the same skillet, and cook and stir just until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes; remove and set aside.
9. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (250 degrees C). Oil a sheet pan generously with olive oil. A sheet of parchment paper can be placed on the pan to prevent sticking.
10. Transfer dough to the prepared sheet pan. Use oiled fingers to press dough into a rectangle that almost covers the pan. If dough is too elastic to stay in place, let it rest for a minute, and then continue stretching and pressing into place.
11. Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over dough and brush to coat evenly.
12. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza crust to a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Remove parchment from pan if used, then return crust to the pan.
13. Spread crust with sauce, scatter over sausage and vegetables, sprinkle with mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese, and finish with a dusting of Parmesan.
14. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are well browned, about 15 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack; let cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then cut and serve.John MitzewichChef's NoteThe bottom of the pizza should be golden brown and crisp, but if it is not, place back on sheet pan, and place over a medium high flame, until you can hear the crust start to sizzle slightly. Rotate the pan so all parts of the bottom crust get toasted and turn golden brown. This is a great way to crisp up a crust, but be careful not to go too far and burn the dough.

Title: Handkerchief Lasagna
Category: italian
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/handkerchief-lasagna-recipe-11709920
Ingredients:
- 2cupsall-purpose flour or "OO" flour
- 3largeeggs
- 12ouncesricotta cheese
- 1ounceParmesan cheese, grated
- 1largeegg yolk
- 1/4cupfinely mincedItalian parsley
- 1teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/2teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1pinchcayenne pepper
- 3cupspreparedmarinara sauce, or any other pasta sauce
- 6freshbasil leaves, torn
- 4ouncesmozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1/4cupgrated Parmesan cheese
Instructions:
1. Make a pile of flour on a work surface, and make a well in the center. Add eggs to the well, and scramble eggs with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from the edges. When the dough becomes too thick to use a fork, use a bench scraper to lift remaining dry flour over the top and begin to cut flour in until a shaggy dough forms.
2. Knead dough by hand until to form a smooth ball, about 3 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Knead until a very smooth and elastic ball of dough forms, about 4 minutes more. The dough recipe makes enough for 2 lasagnas; divide dough in half; wrap tightly and rest 1 piece of dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Freeze remaining dough for another use.
3. For cheese filling, add ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolk, parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne to a bowl, and stir together until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
5. Shape pasta dough with lightly floured hands into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Roll dough out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface into a large, very thin rectangle. The thinner and larger it is, the better. Turn dough over occasionally during rolling to prevent sticking, and dust with flour as needed. Use a pizza cutter to divide dough lengthwise down the center into 2 long strips.
6. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Slowly lower pasta strips into boiling salted water, and cook for 1 minute 30 seconds. Transfer dough into a bowl of cold water until cooled. Transfer onto work surface and cut each strip in half widthwise to make 4 pieces total.
7. Set aside about 1/2 cup of cheese mixture. Dollop the rest of cheese mixture by spoonfuls evenly over the 4 pasta pieces, and spread it out roughly but evenly. Spoon about 1/3 cup of pasta sauce onto each piece.
8. Top each piece of pasta with torn basil. Set aside 3/4 cup mozzarella; scatter the rest evenly over pasta. Fold each piece of pasta in half to form the stuffed handkerchiefs.
9. Spread a layer of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, and place the first handkerchief in the dish. Spread over 1/3 of reserved cheese mixture, followed by a few spoons of sauce, and another small scatter of shredded mozzarella. Repeat layering with remaining 3 handkerchiefs. Top with sauce, remaining mozzarella, and a dusting of Parmesan. Drizzle with olive oil.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is lightly golden brown and the pan is bubbling around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into quarters to serve.John Mitzewich

Title: Cheeseburger Focaccia
Category: italian
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/cheeseburger-focaccia-recipe-11690705
Ingredients:
- 2cupslukewarmwater
- 1(0.25 ounce) packetactive-dry yeast, such as Red Star®
- 1/2teaspoonsugar
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 1tablespoonkosher salt
- 3cupsall-purpose flour
- 2cupsbread flour
- olive oil, as needed
- 1smallonion, finely diced
- 1/2poundground beef
- kosher salt, to taste
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1cupshreddedsharp Cheddar cheese
- 2dill picklespears, diced
Instructions:
1. For the focaccia:Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
2. Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.
3. Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.
4. After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes.
5. At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.
6. For the toppings:Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
7. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
8. Pour about 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil to a skillet and place over medium heat. Once shimmering, add onions and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add ground beef along with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook, breaking the meat up with a heat-safe spatula as it cooks. Cook until beef is nearly browned with just a few specks of pink remaining, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat and set aside to cool.
9. Once focaccia has risen for an hour and meat has cooled slightly, lightly drizzle the surface of the focaccia with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter cheese in an even layer. Dimple the surface again, then dollop meat and onions all over the surface.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until the focaccia and cheese are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes, then sprinkle chopped pickles all over before slicing and serving.

Title: Chef John’s Chicken Saltimbocca
Category: italian
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/chef-john-s-chicken-saltimbocca-recipe-8642251
Ingredients:
- 2skinless,boneless chicken breasts
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4 to 8sage leaves, or as needed
- 3thin slicesprosciutto
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 2tablespoonsMarsala wine or white wine
- 1/2lemon, juiced
- 1/3cupchicken broth
- 2tablespoonscoldunsalted butter
- 2lemon wedges (optional)
Instructions:
1. Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 3/8-inch thickness. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
2. With the smoother side of chicken breasts facing up, lay 2 to 4 sage leaves on each breast; more sage leaves will give a stronger sage flavor. Then, cover breasts with a single layer of prosciutto, covering the sage underneath.
3. Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top, and press down firmly to flatten. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before cooking for best results.
4. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken, prosciutto-side down. in the pan, and sear until prosciutto is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over, and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes more. Exact time will depend on size and thickness of chicken breasts.
5. Turn off heat, remove chicken to a plate, and cover loosely with foil.
6. For the sauce, add Marsala, lemon juice, and chicken broth to the pan, along with any accumulated juices from the plate with chicken, and place back over medium-high heat. Boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and swirl in butter until it disappears.
7. Spoon sauce generously over chicken saltimbocca and add a lemon wedge on the side.John MitzewichChef's Notes:Sauce is optional, and chicken can be served with just the pan drippings spooned over the top.Sage leaves can be placed on top of prosciutto, instead of underneath, for a different, milder flavor. Or, after chicken is cooked, the sage can simply be fried in the pan until crisp and used to top the plate.

- 1tablespoonanchovy paste, or to taste
- 4clovesgarlic,peeled and thinly sliced
- 1teaspooncrushed red pepper(optional)

- fresh Italian parsley sprigsfor garnish (optional)
Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it shimmers.
3. Add capers, anchovy paste, garlic, and red pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes.
4. Drain off about 1/2 cup of the liquid in the tomato can and discard. With clean hands, crush tomatoes, and add to the skillet with the remaining juice. Stir in olives and minced parsley. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
5. Bring sauce to a boil, add fish filets, and reduce heat to a simmer. Sauce should bubble occasionally, but not boil, once fish have been added.
6. Cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes, spooning sauce over fish occasionally. Thin filets may cook more quickly. An instant read thermometer inserted in the fish should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
7. Evenly divide spaghetti into 4 serving dishes. Place 1 filet in each dish and ladle sauce over all. Garnish with parsley sprigs.Cook’s NoteI did not salt the fish, before placing in the sauce. With the olives, capers, and anchovies, we found the fish well-seasoned.If you’d like a salad, a green vegetable, or bread with this recipe, I suggest you get them going first. Once you start this dish, it will come together quickly.

4. Mix in sesame oil and cover. As the sauce rests, the beans will settle and the oil will float, creating a barrier which will protect it from mold. The sauce is ready to use or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

Title: Perfect Pot Stickers
Category: chinese
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/261153/perfect-pot-stickers/
Ingredients:
- 1poundground pork
- 4clovesminced garlic
- ½cupfinely chopped green onions
- 3tablespoonsvery finely minced fresh ginger
- 2tablespoonssoy sauce
- 1teaspoonsoy sauce
- 1teaspoonsesame oil
- 1pinchcayenne pepper
- 1 ½cupsfinely chopped green cabbage
- 2 ½cupsall-purpose flour, or more as needed
- ¾teaspoonkosher salt
- 1cuphot water, about 130 - 150 F (55-65 C)
- ¼cupseasoned rice vinegar
- ¼cupsoy sauce
- 6tablespoonsvegetable oil for frying, or as needed - divided
- 8tablespoonswater for steaming, divided
Instructions:
1. To make the filling: Place ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne in a mixing bowl. Top with chopped green cabbage. Mix with fork until thoroughly combined. Tamp down lightly; cover with plastic. Refrigerate until chilled, about an hour.
2. To make the dough: Place 2 ½ cups of flour and kosher salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour in hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a shaggy dough. Flour your hands and transfer dough to a work surface. Knead dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 3 to 5 minutes. If dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour, up to an additional 1/2 cup, and continue to knead. Wrap dough ball in plastic, and let it rest about 30 minutes.Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
3. When dough has rested, divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 pieces with a dish cloth while you work the first piece. Roll into a small log about the thickness of a thumb, about 3/4 inch. Divide each log into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin 3 ½-inch circle on a lightly floured surface to form the pot sticker wrappers. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces.Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
4. Lightly moisten the edges of a wrapper with your wet finger. Place a small scoop of the ground pork mixture onto the center of a wrapper. Fold up the 2 sides and pinch together in the center. Pinch together the remaining edges, forming "pleats" along one side. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to slightly flatten the bottom; form a slight curve in it so it stands upright in the pan. Transfer to a well-floured plate. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
5. To make the dipping sauce: Mix seasoned rice vinegar and soy sauce together in a small mixing bowl. Set aside.
6. Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place about 6 or 7 pot stickers in the hot oil, flat-side down. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drizzle in water and quickly cover the pan; steam for 3 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until water evaporates and bottoms are browned and crunchy, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to a warm serving dish. Repeat with remaining pot stickers.Dotdash Meredith Food Studios

Title: Green Onion Garlic Naan Bread
Category: indian
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8467738/green-onion-garlic-naan-bread/
Ingredients:
- 1 ½cupsbread flour, plus more as needed
- ½teaspoonkosher salt
- 2teaspoonsbaking powder
- 1cupplain Greek yogurt
- 4clovesgarlic, crushed
- ½cupthinly sliced green onions
- 2tablespoonsmelted butter
Instructions:
1. Place bread flour in a bowl. Add salt and baking powder and give it a good whisk until evenly combined.
2. Add in Greek yogurt gently, followed by garlic and green onions. Take a wooden spoon and slowly start mixing everything together. Keep mixing, stirring, and pressing until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Transfer dough to a work surface and use your hands to press dough together. Knead for a few minutes until dough becomes elastic and a little bit sticky. Add a bit more flour as necessary but try to keep extra flour at an absolute minimum. Knead until dough is a little bit stretchy, 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Wrap in plastic and allow to rest on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes.
5. Take a bench scraper and cut into 6 equal pieces. Take 1 portion and roll into a ball. Place onto a generously floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch or less. It's ok if the naan is not a perfect circle. You will need extra flour for rolling out as the dough is sticky, but try to use as little as possible.
6. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Transfer dough circles into the hot dry skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the surface and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip naan over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly with a spatula to increase the heat during cooking. Flip over twice more and cook for an additional 15 seconds per side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve the texture. Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the skillet onto a plate.
7. Cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm and moist while you cook the other naan breads. Stack all 6 naan breads on top of each other and keep covered with a kitchen towel.
8. When you are finished cooking all 6 naan breads, unstack breads and brush the first naan bread on both sides with a little bit of melted butter. Stack second piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan into a triangle and serve.Chef John

- 2tablespoonsplain yogurt
- 3tablespoonsfresh lemon juice, or more as needed
- 4cupscoldwater
- 4clovesgarlic, crushed
- 2 to3tablespoonsSrirachachili sauce, or other hot chili sauce
- 2tablespoonsplain yogurt

- 1/3cupplain yogurt
- 1/4cupfinely choppedcilantro leaves
- 2tablespoonsdicedjalapeno pepper
- 1lime, juiced
- saltto taste
Instructions:
1. Heat milk in a large pot on between medium and medium-high heat to 195 degrees F to 205 degrees F (90 to 9 degrees C) until milk is almost simmering. Reduce heat to low, and stir in yogurt and 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Stir for about 30 seconds, and if milk isn’t separating into curds and whey, stir in another 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice.
2. Once curds form, turn off heat, and pour in cold water to stop the cooking process and cool mixture. Pour curds into a cheesecloth or a cotton towel lined colander and drain out whey. Whey can be reserved for other uses.
3. Let curds sit and drain for 5 to 10 minutes, before gathering up the cloth, and squeezing out excess liquid. Be careful to not burn yourself, as the liquid may still be very hot. Press curds between layers of cloth into a disc of about 2 inches high, being careful not to leave excess cloth bunched up on top, or underneath the cheese. Place something flat over the cheese, and place a heavy pan on top to weigh down. Leave paneer under the weight until very firm to the touch, 30 to 90 minutes. Wrap and refrigerate until well chilled before using.
4. For the chili garlic marinade combine garlic, Scriracha, yogurt. lemon juice, garam masala, and kosher salt in a bowl; mix until well combined.
5. Cut paneer into squares or rectangles about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, and add to the marinade, tossing well to coat thoroughly on both sides. Wrap and marinate paneer for at least 4 hours.
6. Combine yogurt, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, and salt for the yogurt dipping sauce in a blender; blend until smooth.
7. Melt butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat and pan-fry paneer until well browned, about 2 minutes per side. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.Chef John

- 3ouncesgoat cheese, crumbled
- 1(17.3 ounce) packagefrozenpuff pastry(2 sheets), thawed
- 1cupflour, for dusting
- 1largeegg, lightly beaten
- 1tablespoonwater
- 1(12 ounce) jarmushroom gravy, warmed, for serving
Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drizzle sweet potatoes with 1 tablespoon melted butter and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Wrap each potato in foil and put on a 10x15-inch rimmed baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour.
3. Let sweet potatoes cool completely, about 1 hour. (Baked sweet potatoes can be chilled up to 5 days. Let chilled potatoes stand at room temperature 30 minutes before assembling in Step 5.)
4. Meanwhile, add 1 1/2 cups broth, rice, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until rice is tender, 40 to 45 minutes; drain any excess water.
5. Meanwhile, melt 1/4 cup butter in a very large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, mushrooms are starting to brown, and onion is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Add sherry; cook until evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in tarragon and remaining 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Stir in rice mixture and goat cheese until combined. Spread in an even layer on baking sheet and let cool completely. (If filling is hot, pastry will tear and not bake properly.)
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut each puff pastry sheet into quarters to make 8 pieces. Roll 6 pieces to 6 1/2 inch squares on a lightly floured surface. Evenly pile filling onto center of each square (about 1/3 cup per square). Top each with a sweet potato.
7. Line a clean baking sheet with foil. Beat together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush edges of topped pastry squares with egg wash. Bring up corners of pastry and gently stretch over potatoes; pinch edges to seal. Arrange bundles, seam sides down, on prepared baking sheet. Cut decorative shapes from remaining 2 pastry pieces. Arrange pastry shapes on bundles and brush with remaining egg wash to adhere.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. (An instant read thermometer inserted into centers is the easiest way to test doneness. Thermometer should register at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let stand 10 minutes. Serve with mushroom gravy.From the Editor:Use a puff pastry product that is free of animal products, such as Pepperidge Farm.VEGAN-IZE: Replace butter with olive oil, omit cheese, and substitute unsweetened plain plant based milk for the egg wash in Step 6.MAKE IT MEATY:Substitute 6 (6 to 8 ounce) beef tenderloin filets for the sweet potatoes. Season as directed. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a very large skillet over medium high heat. Add fillets; sear, turning halfway through, about 3 minutes. Transfer fillets to a wire rack and let stand 30 minutes. Continue as directed, but in Step 5, top each pile of filling with a fillet. Continue as directed except roast in a 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) oven 18 to 22 minutes or until desired doneness (135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium rare).

Add zucchini and season with 1 teaspoon salt and cracked black pepper. You may have to add zucchini in batches if it doesn't all fit in the pan.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
3. Stir every few minutes until zucchini is softened and liquid is drawn out of it, 5 to 10 minutes. Continue to cook until liquid is evaporated, and zucchini starts to brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta for 1 to 2 minutes less than the package states for al dente pasta. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta; set aside.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
5. Turn heat under the skillet to medium-low, and stir zucchini frequently in the final 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. As zucchini caramelizes, it may start to stick to the bottom of the pan. You can loosen it by adding a little more olive oil or a few tablespoons of water; use a wooden spoon to release the browned bits (or fond) on the bottom of the pan. Zucchini is done when it starts to clump together, and looks darkened in color and slightly browned.Allrecipes / Qi Ai

6. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. About 7 minutes before the baked feta is finished in the oven, add the pasta and boil until tender with a bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Before draining pasta, ladle out 1/2 to 3/4 cup pasta cooking water; set aside. Drain pasta.
7. Remove baked feta dish from the oven; use a fork to smash and stir feta and tomatoes into a sauce, breaking up the tomato skins as small as possible. Stir in basil, a few tablespoons  reserved pasta water, and the hot, drained pasta.
8. Toss everything thoroughly until pasta is evenly coated with sauce; add a few splashes pasta cooking water as needed to adjust texture. Serve with more fresh basil on top if desired.John MitzewichChef's NotePasta can be served with additional feta crumbled over-the-top.Tearing the basil leaves is best, but if slicing, be sure use a sharp knife so that leaves don’t turn black.

2. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until potatoes are very soft, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and add back into the pot or into a bowl.

Season to taste with salt; serve with more olive oil drizzled over the top if desired.John MitzewichChef's Notes:A mild, buttery olive oil is the best choice for this recipe, rather than one with a peppery, grassy flavor.You can use Yukon gold potatoes, but the texture will not be as light and fluffy.For more intense garlic flavor, garlic can be finely crushed and added raw to the potatoes when olive oil is added.

- 1/2teaspoonfinesea salt
- 1tablespoonnutritional yeast
- 1tablespoonapple cider vinegar
- 3tablespoonsplain cashewmilkyogurt
- 1/4cupwater, or as needed
Instructions:
1. Place cashews in a bowl with enough cold water to cover, and soak cashews overnight or up to 24 hours.
2. Drain, and add nuts to a blender, along with sea salt, nutritional yeast, vinegar, cashew yogurt, and water. Blend on high until very smooth.
3. Transfer into a sterilized glass container (See Note), and let ferment in a warm spot for 8 to 24 hours, or until the mixture is as tangy and fermented as you want.
4. This can be done at room temperature, which will take longer, or wrapped in a heating pad set on low (about 90 degrees F (32 degrees C)), which will speed up the process.
5. Check, stir, and taste mixture a few times during the process to monitor its progress.
6. Once the mixture has fermented as long as you want, season with salt to taste. At this point, additional flavoring can be added such as garlic, herbs, or spices.
7. Chill before serving, at least 1 hour. For best results, refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours to let the flavors develop even more.John MitzewichFrom the Editor:To prevent rogue bacteria from taking over the fermentation process, use very clean tools. A dishwasher set to sanitize might be adequate for cleaning the spoon and blender you use, but the fermentation container and lid should be sterilized. Here are 3 easy methods for sterilizing:Fill a bowl with boiling water to the brim; immerse container and lid. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain and air dry.Wash and rinse container and lid; air dry. Place the container and lid in the oven at 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) for 10 minutes.Dilute 1 teaspoon bleach in 3 1/2 quarts water. Immerse and soak equipment for 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with hot water. Air dry. Cover until ready to use to avoid recontamination.

Title: Lobster Roll Khachapuri
Category: seafood
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/lobster-roll-khachapuri-recipe-11749292
Ingredients:
- 1cupwarmwater
- 1packetactive dry yeast
- 2tablespoonswhite sugar
- 1largeegg
- 3tablespoonsmeltedbutter
- 3 1/2cupsall-purpose flour
- 1 1/2teaspoonskosher salt
- 2(6 ounce)lobster tails
- 1tablespoonchoppedfresh tarragon, plus more for garnish (optional)
- 1lemon, zested
- 1teaspoonseafood seasoning, such as Old Bay®
- 1pinchcayenne pepperor smoked paprika, plus more for garnish (optional)
- 1/2cupmayonnaise
- 8ouncesMonterey Jack cheese
- 1largeegg
- 1teaspoonwater
Instructions:
1. For dough, add warm water to the bowl of a stand mixer, and sprinkle yeast over the top. Let sit for about 10 minutes.
2. Whisk sugar, egg, and melted butter into the bowl. Add flour and salt, and knead using a dough hook until a very soft, sticky, relatively elastic dough is formed, about 5 minutes, scraping the sides down occasionally if necessary.
3. Remove from the mixer and use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover and let dough rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2  hours.
4. Lightly flour a work surface, and scrape dough out onto the surface. Lightly flour your hands; form dough into a smooth ball, using a bench scraper to assist if necessary. Transfer dough into an oiled resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out most of the air and seal tightly. Place in the refrigerator overnight before using.Chef's NoteThe dough can be used immediately without refrigerating overnight, but the taste and texture will be better if it is.
5. For filling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
6. Place lobster tails on the prepared baking sheet and cut each lobster tail down the center with scissors. Spread open the shell to expose the meat and remove the digestive tract if necessary. Grab lobster meat from the thick end, and peel towards the tail, to separate meat from the shell. Lay meat back into the shell in its original position.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until meat has just turned opaque and lightly firm, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes, and then dice into 1/4-inch pieces.
8. Transfer lobster meat into a bowl. Add tarragon, lemon zest, Old Bay seasoning, cayenne, and mayonnaise. Mix until thoroughly combined, cover, and refrigerate until needed. Turn the oven off if not proceeding immediately.
9. For khachapuri, place chilled dough on a lightly floured surface, and divide into 4 equal portions. Form each portion into a ball, and use a rolling pin to roll each dough into a circle about 9 inches across.
10. Divide filling into 4 equal portions. For each circle of dough, transfer about 1/3 of the filling portion in a ring pattern about 1 inch away from the edge. Sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese over the whole dough circle, except for a 1-inch border around the edge.
11. Roll 2 opposite edges of dough towards the center, until the rolled sides about 1 1/2 inches apart in the middle. Twist the ends together to seal the dough, and twist into 2 points, to create a boat shape.
12. Transfer khachapuri to silpat or parchment-lined baking sheets. You should be able to fit 2 per pan. Set the rest of the lobster filling evenly into the centers of each “boat.” Spread filling out to fill the space but don’t pack down.
13. Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl; paint exposed dough with egg wash. Top evenly with remaining cheese. If desired, sprinkle with paprika or cayenne.
14. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C).
15. Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer onto a cooling rack; let cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with additional paprika or cayenne and chopped fresh tarragon.John Mitzewich

- 1/2teaspoongarlic powder
- 1pinchcayenne
- 1wholebranzino (about 1.25 pounds), scaled and gutted

- 2sprigstarragon
- 2sprigs Italian parsley
- 1tablespoonolive oil
- 1largelemon, quartered
Instructions:
1. Mix salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne together in small bowl to make seasoning salt.
2. Place the fish on a large piece of parchment paper. Generously season the inside cavity of the fish with the seasoning salt. Stuff chives, tarragon, and parsley into the cavity, making sure everything’s tucked inside. Brush the outside of the fish with olive oil, and season both sides generously with the salt mixture.Chef's NoteYou can substitute other fresh herbs to your liking.
3. Wrap fish up in parchment paper and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Fish can also be grilled immediately if desired.
4. Meanwhile, build a small charcoal fire in your grill, and let it burn until the coals are almost all white.  If necessary, move some of the coals away from the center, so the heat is not too intense directly under the fish.
5. Carefully place the stuffed fish onto the grill. Grill on the first side for about 4 minutes, then carefully flip over. Grill the second side for about 4 minutes. If temperature is too hot, grill can be covered with the vent open during cooking time to lower the temperature of the coals. Once both sides of the fish have browned, you can carefully turn it back and forth every few minutes until fish is cooked to the desired doneness.
6. Check for doneness with a thermometer. The internal temperature in the thickest part of the fish should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Remove the fish from the grill and serve with fresh lemon wedges.John Mitzewich

- 1stickunsalted butter, sliced into 8 pieces
Instructions:
1. Place chicken thighs into a slow cooker. Sprinkle over the powdered au jus gravy mix, ranch dressing, and chili powder. Top with cannellinibeans, pepperoncini pepper brine, fire roasted diced tomatoes, sliced pepperoncini peppers, and butter.
2. Cover, and cook until chicken thighs are fork tender, on High for 3 to 4 hours or on Low for 6 to 8 hours.  During the cooking time, use tongs or a long spoon to stir and redistribute the ingredients every hour or so.
3. Once chicken is tender, transfer chicken thighs to a bowl. Use a pair of the kitchen scissors to cut chicken thighs into about 1-2-inch pieces. Transfer chicken thighs back into the chili in the slow cooker, and stir to combine. Reduce heat setting to warm mode, and taste for seasoning before serving.John MitzewichChef's NoteYou can use chicken breasts instead of thighs, but the thighs make for a better chili, and won’t dry out during the long cooking time.For a more pronounced chili flavor, you can double the amount of chili powder. For a spicier version, ground chipotle can be substituted for some of the chili powder.

Instructions:
1. Combine olive oil, garlic, thyme, oregano, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a blender or small food processor the day before. Pulse several times to purée; pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken pieces; massage the contents until chicken is coated with marinade. Press out as much air as possible, seal the bag, and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.
2. Combine olive oil, mayonnaise, white wine vinegar, white sugar, shallot, dry mustard, salt, and poppyseeds in a small jar with a lid for the dressing. Stir rapidly to blend, or cover and shake vigorously. Refrigerate until ready to use. Liquids will separate, so shake again before use.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Clean and oil the grates.
4. Grill chicken on the hot grates until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to rest and cool for about 10 minutes, then chop into bite-sized pieces.
5. To assemble salad, add about 3 tablespoons poppyseed dressing to the bottom of each of 2 (1-quart) Mason jars. Alternatively, you may keep dressing separate, and dress salad on the plate.
6. To each jar, add 1/2 of chopped celery, 1/2 of scallion, 1/2 cup broccoli slaw, 1/2 cup strawberries, and 1 tablespoon feta. Fill each jar with torn salad greens, and add 1 1/2 tablespoons sliced almonds on top of greens. Put lids on the jars, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
7. To serve, open the jars and shake out the contents on a plate. Dress with poppyseed dressing, if kept separate.Cook’s NoteThese amounts are meant to be a guide. Want more dressing? That’s fine. The recipe makes about 1/2 cup of dressing. Don't care for celery? Leave it out.

Title: Ayam Bakar (Indonesian Grilled Chicken)
Category: chicken
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/ayam-bakar-indonesian-grilled-chicken-recipe-11766874
Ingredients:
- 3/4cupslicedshallots
- 6clovesgarlic, peeled
- 1(3 inch)pieceginger, peeled and sliced
- 1stalklemongrass, inside white part only, sliced
- 4kaffir lime leaves(optional)
- 3tablespoonsvegetable oil
- 2teaspoonsgroundcoriander
- 1teaspoongroundcumin
- 1/2teaspoongroundturmeric
- 1/2teaspoongroundwhite pepper
- 1teaspoonkosher salt
- 1tablespoonsambalchili sauce, or to taste
- 1/4cupbrown sugar
- 1/4cupsoy sauce
- 2cupschicken broth
- 2leafbay leaves
- 6thigh with skinchicken thighs
Instructions:
1. Combine shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and lime leaves in a food processor or blender, and grind into a very fine paste.
2. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet and transfer in the mixture from the food processor. Spread out into an even layer. Sprinkle over the coriander, cumin, turmeric, white pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring, until the mixture starts to caramelize onto the bottom of the pan and has become very fragrant, about 4 minutes.
3. Add sambal, brown sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, and bay leaves, and use a spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
4. With skin side up, make 3 cuts into the center of each thigh, perpendicular to the bone, about 1/2-inch apart. Place chicken into the sauce, skin side down, and reduce the heat to between low and medium-low.
5. Baste the top of chicken with sauce. Cover; simmer for 15 minutes. Uncover; turn thighs over. Cook for another 15 minutes, basting occasionally.
6. Continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until thighs are tender but not falling off the bone, and sauce has reduced and become very thick. If chicken is finished cooking before sauce is reduced, remove the chicken to a plate, set aside, and continue to reduce the sauce a few minutes more. Reduce heat to low plac;e chicken back in until heated through.
7. Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal grill for medium-high heat. Grill chicken over charcoal, turning and repositioning often, or until about half of the surface is charred, about 2 minutes per side. Less direct heat can be used for less charring, but the smoky bittersweet grill marks are a key part of the dish.
8. Serve grilled chicken thighs on top of the sauce, with more sambal if desired.John MitzewichChef's NoteSome Indonesian recipes call for using coconut water, or coconut milk rather than chicken broth. This recipe is quite rich; I prefer chicken broth or even water.The chicken can also be charred indoors on a very hot grill pan, or placed under the broiler until lightly charred.

Ingredients:
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 1tablespoonbalsamic vinegar
- 1/2teaspoonherbs
- 1/8teaspoongarlic
- 8ouncestrip steak
- 3mozzarella pearls
- 3cherry tomatoes
- 3freshbasil leaves
- 1teaspoonbalsamic glaze, or to taste
Instructions:
1. Add olive oil, balsamic vinegar, herbs, and garlic to a resealable plastic bag. Pat the strip steak dry and add steak into the marinade. Reseal the bag; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
2. Brush grill grates with oil or grill spray. Preheat a gas grill with burners on High and lid closed for 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Remove steak from marinade, and allow excess to drip off; discard marinade. Place steak directly on grill grates over High heat. Sear with lid closed, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Rotate steak 45 degrees halfway through cooking on each side for crosshatch grill marks.
4. Move steak to indirect heat and cook to your preferred doneness, 1 to 2 minutes per side for a rare strip steak or 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove to a platter and keep warm.
5. Quarter mozzarella pearls and cherry tomatoes, and slice basil leaves into very thin strips. Place topping on steak and drizzle with balsamic glaze to serve.Cook’s NoteThe snack-size portions of mozzarella by Belgioso are the perfect size for the caprese topping.I do not recommend grilling the steak beyond medium rare. The balsamic vinegar in the marinade may go from caramelized to burned if cooked longer.

Title: Bistro-Style Steak
Category: beef
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/bistro-style-steak-recipe-8787026
Ingredients:
- 1(14-ounce)New York strip steak
- 3/4teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/2teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1teaspoonvegetable oil
- 1teaspoonmeltedclarified butter
- 2tablespoonsmincedshallots
- 1/3cupwhite wine
- 1/3cupbeef bone broth
- 2tablespoonsunsalted butter, cubed
Instructions:
1. Trim any excess fat from the steak, then trim off the tough membrane by running a sharp knife between the membrane and the meat under the fat cap of the steak. Season evenly on both sides with salt and pepper, and place on a crinkled-up piece of foil set on a plate.
2. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 2 and up to 10 hours, turning occasionally.
3. Bring the steak out of the refrigerator to sit at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before beginning to cook, turning over once halfway through.
4. Place a heavy duty steel pan over high heat, and add oil and clarified butter. When the fats are hot and start to shimmer, place steak in the pan. When steak begins to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium.
5. Cook the first side for 2 minutes, then pick up the steak with tongs, and rub the seared surface around the pan to redistribute the fat under the steak. Sear the first side for 2 minutes more, for a total of 4 minutes.
6. Turn steak over and repeat searing on the second side, 4 minutes total, or until the steak is cooked to your desired doneness. For medium rare, remove steak when an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reaches 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Turn off the heat, remove the steak to a plate, cover very loosely with foil, and let rest while you make the pan sauce, about 5 minutes.
7. For sauce, add minced shallots to the still-hot pan, and cook, stirring, until they start to soften and take on some color, about 1 minute. If there is not enough residual heat in the pan for this step, turn heat back on to medium.
8. Turn the heat to high, and add wine. Cook, stirring, until wine reduces by at least half, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the beef bone broth, and cook until the liquids in the pan reduce by about 3/4, 1 to 2 minutes more. Turn off heat.
9. Add cold butter cubes, and swirl the pan until butter disappears and a slightly thick, glossy sauce has formed, about 30 seconds. Season with a pinch of salt if needed, and serve over rested steak.John MitzewichChef's NotesUse any tender cut of steak with a similar thickness for this recipe.Garlic and/or onion can be used with, or instead of, shallots.For sauce, red wine can be used instead of white, but I prefer the slightly less intense flavor of white.A tablespoon of wine vinegar stirred into 1/4 cup water can be substituted for wine.

Instructions:
1. Place corned beef along with the contents of spice packet into a pot, and cover by 2 inches with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours 15 minutes. While corned beef is cooking, occasionally add more water to keep the level near where it was when it started boiling.
2. Remove corned beef to a bowl, and let cool until cool enough to handle, at least 30 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid.
3. When meat is cool, slice off most of the fat. Cut meat with the grain into thick strips, and then turn and slice into thin, bite-sized pieces. Reserve until needed.
4. Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt to the hot pan, and cook and stir until mushrooms are nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Add onions, and continue cooking until they soften and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add butter and stir until melted.
5. Make a space in the center of the pan, add garlic, and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour, and cook and stir for 1 minute more. Pour in white wine and reserved corned beef cooking liquid, and stir to combine. Raise the heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring, until sauce reduces by about half and thickens, 3 to 5 minutes more.
6. Stir in beef broth, and continue to boil and reduce until sauce thickens again, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in crème fraiche, and reduce until the sauce is as thick as you’d like, a few more minutes.
7. Stir in sliced corned beef, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh dill.
8. Garnish each serving with a small dollop of crème fraiche or sour cream and a little fresh dill.John MitzewichChef's Note:An option is to cook the corned beef a day ahead, and chill in the refrigerator. It is easy to remove the fat and slice when very cold.

Title: Cheeseburger Focaccia
Category: beef
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/cheeseburger-focaccia-recipe-11690705
Ingredients:
- 2cupslukewarmwater
- 1(0.25 ounce) packetactive-dry yeast, such as Red Star®
- 1/2teaspoonsugar
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 1tablespoonkosher salt
- 3cupsall-purpose flour
- 2cupsbread flour
- olive oil, as needed
- 1smallonion, finely diced
- 1/2poundground beef
- kosher salt, to taste
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1cupshreddedsharp Cheddar cheese
- 2dill picklespears, diced
Instructions:
1. For the focaccia:Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
2. Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.
3. Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.
4. After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes.
5. At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.
6. For the toppings:Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
7. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
8. Pour about 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil to a skillet and place over medium heat. Once shimmering, add onions and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add ground beef along with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook, breaking the meat up with a heat-safe spatula as it cooks. Cook until beef is nearly browned with just a few specks of pink remaining, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess fat and set aside to cool.
9. Once focaccia has risen for an hour and meat has cooled slightly, lightly drizzle the surface of the focaccia with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter cheese in an even layer. Dimple the surface again, then dollop meat and onions all over the surface.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until the focaccia and cheese are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes, then sprinkle chopped pickles all over before slicing and serving.

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner or parchment paper.
2. Combine butter, garlic, lemon zest, Dijon mustard, salt, red pepper flakes, smoked paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, chives, and parsley in a bowl; mash and mix until evenly combined. Add lemon juice and mix until thoroughly incorporated.
3. Generously apply the butter to both sides of bread slices and place on the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then turn the bread over, and bake until toast is as browned and crisp around the edge as you like, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside until needed.
5. Transfer remaining butter onto a piece of plastic wrap, and shape into a 2-inch diameter cylinder. Refrigerated until needed, then slice into medallions for serving.
6. Turn the steak on its side, and slice down the middle, cutting the filet into 2 equal sized 4-ounce portions. Season both sides with salt.
7. Place a skillet over high heat, and add avocado oil. Once the oil is shimmering, sear steaks for about 2 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked to your desired doneness. Turn off the heat, and transfer the steaks on your plate to rest for 3 to 4 minutes, while you deglaze the pan.
8. To deglaze pan, add beef broth into the still-hot pan, and scrape the bottom with a spoon or spatula to release any caramelized bits. There should be enough heat in the pan to reduce the liquid down to about 2 tablespoons, but if not, turn the heat to medium-high until reduced.
9. Place steak on toast, and drizzle over the pan drippings. Top with a slice of cowboy butter, and enjoy.John Mitzewich

Ingredients:

- 1/2teaspoonsea salt, or to taste
- 2tablespoonswhole peppercorns
- 1tablespoonunsalted butter
- 1tablespoonolive oil
- 1/4cupminced shallots
- 4garlic cloves, minced
- 3sprigsfresh thyme, plus more for garnish (optional)
- 1/3cupcognac
- 1cupheavy cream
Instructions:
1. Gather all ingredients.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
2. Pat steaks dry with paper towels; season on both sides with sea salt.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
3. Place whole peppercorns on a wooden cutting board, and crack peppercorns with an iron skillet or heavy pan. Lightly pound peppercorns, then rub peppercorns in a circular motion over the cutting board until pieces of pepper are fairly uniform, and more coarse than ground black pepper. Press cracked pepper into both sides of steaks; let stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
4. Heat butter and olive oil in a 10-inch iron skillet over medium-high heat. When butter stops sizzling and oil is hot, reduce heat to medium and carefully add steaks to the hot oil. Cook about 3 minutes per side, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 120 degrees F (50 degrees C) for medium-rare.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
5. Remove steaks from pan; tent with aluminum foil to keep warm. To the same skillet, over medium-low heat, add minced shallots and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and thyme sprigs; cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
6. Remove the pan from heat and slowly and carefully pour in the cognac (adding cognac over heat or adding too quickly could cause it to ignite). Return the pan to the burner and stir to combine. Cook until the liquid is evaporated.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
7. Stir in cream; continue cooking until sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
8. To serve, spread sauce on a serving platter. Slice steaks thinly on the diagonal, and place on the sauce. Garnish with additional thyme sprigs, if desired.Allrecipes / Qi AiCook’s NoteUse whatever peppercorns you have. A mix of green, white, and black peppercorns is nice, but not necessary.An internal temperature of 120 degrees F (50 degrees C), gives a nice medium-rare steak. If you prefer less rare, add about a minute of cooking time to each side. You may need to reduce the heat of the skillet even more, to avoid burning.

Title: Loaded Potato Focaccia
Category: pork
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/loaded-potato-focaccia-recipe-11690909
Ingredients:
- 2cupslukewarmwater
- 1(0.25 ounce) packetactive-dry yeast, such asRed Star®
- 1/2teaspoonsugar
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 1tablespoonkosher salt
- 3cupsall-purpose flour
- 2cupsbread flour
- olive oil, as needed
- 1Yukon gold potato, thinly sliced on a mandoline
- kosher salt, to taste
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1cupshreddedsharp Cheddar cheese
- 4slicesbacon, cooked and crumbled
- 2scallions, thinly sliced
Instructions:
1. For the focaccia: Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
2. Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of flour remain.
3. Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.
4. After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes.
5. At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.
6. For the toppings:Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
7. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
8. Once focaccia has risen for an hour, drizzle the surface with olive oil. Use your fingers to dimple the surface, then scatter cheese in an even layer. Dimple the surface again, then layer the potato slices on top. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with crumbled bacon.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until the focaccia and cheese are golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.
10. Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes, then sprinkle sliced scallions all over before slicing and serving.

Title: Campfire Carnitas
Category: pork
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/campfire-carnitas-recipe-11768049
Ingredients:
- 4poundsbonelesspork shoulder
- 4teaspoonskosher salt,or 1 teaspoon per pound of meat
- 1teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1/2teaspoonMexicanoregano
- 1white onion,sliced
- 1Fresnochili pepper,seeded and halved, or more to taste
- 6garlic cloves,skin on
Instructions:
1. Cut pork into 2-inch pieces. Stack 2 (7x10x3-inch) disposable foil baking pans and transfer in the pork. Season with salt, pepper, and oregano, and toss with your hands until everything is evenly coated.
2. Cover the pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and crimp tightly around the edges. Place on top of another large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and then wrap the foil up over the pan. All seams should be rolled facing up. Repeat with 2 more sheets of aluminum foil.
3. Place pan next to a campfire, or in a charcoal grill, and arrange the burning coals evenly around the pan. Wrap a sheet pan in foil, place over the pan, and arrange some charcoal on top.
4. Use a probe or laser thermometer to check the temperature on the surface of the bottom pan, as well as the ambient temperature next to the pan. Try to maintain a constant temperature of between 250 to 300 degrees F (120 to 150 degrees C). To do this, move charcoal further away or closer to the pan as needed. If cooking next to a campfire and the pan is getting more heat from one direction than the other, rotate the pan occasionally. Cook until falling-apart tender, 4 to 5 hours.Chef's NotesIf cooked at the higher end of the temperature range, pork will be ready in about 4 hours. Cooking at the lower end of the range will probably take 5 hours. Move the pan occasionally, so that it does not remain over or too near the hottest part of the fire—if the oil overheats it can leak out and cause flare ups. Anytime the pan is getting too hot, simply pull it away from the fire. Use long metal tongs and heatproof gloves when working with the pork and the fire.If using a grill, keep the pan covered, and use grill vents to adjust temperature.To safely check doneness, always remove pan to a safe location before opening the foil.
5. Remove pan from the fire, and let rest for up to 1 hour, or serve immediately. Carefully cut foil away and peel back. Serve made into tacos, nachos, or enjoyed in hot dog or hamburger buns.John Mitzewich

- 1/2teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1/2teaspoongarlic powder
- 1/2teaspoononion powder
- 1pinchcayenne pepper
- 1tablespoonslicedgreen onion
Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil.
2. For ribs, place ribs on the prepared pan, meat side down. Use a sharp knife to make a few slashes and puncture marks into the meat through the membrane that covers the ribs.
3. Turn the rack meat side up, and paint mustard evenly over the surface. Combine salt, pepper, and paprika in a small bowl and then sprinkle evenly over mustard. For this recipe, the underside of the rack does not need to be seasoned.
4. Bake ribs in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove and allow to cool completely on the counter, about 1 hour. Wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 1 hour.
5. Unwrap ribs and slice evenly between each bone to separate into individual ribs.
6. For sauce, pour water into a pan and bring to a simmer on medium-high heat. Add teabags, and give the water a stir. Turn off the heat and let tea steep for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove teabags; squeeze liquid back into the pan.
7. Add sugar, vinegar, chili powder, paprika, cumin, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne to the pan and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 3 minutes.
8. Reduce heat to low, and add the ribs. Place ribs on their sides, so they fit compactly together. Baste or brush tops with sauce, cover, and simmer gently for about 40 minutes, turning ribs over once halfway through cooking time.
9. Uncover, increase heat to medium-low, and turn ribs over again. Simmer until meat is very tender, but not yet falling off the bone, basting and turning ribs occasionally, 20 to 40 minutes more.
10. Once tender, remove ribs to a plate and set aside. Cook sauce over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce starts to thicken, about 5 minutes.
11. Transfer ribs back into sauce, reduce heat to low, and cook ribs, basting occasionally until heated through and sauce is syrupy, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sliced green onions to serve.John Mitzewich

Title: Pistachio Stuffed Pork Tenderloin
Category: pork
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/pistachio-stuffed-pork-tenderloin-recipe-11690496
Ingredients:
- 1(1 1/4 pound)pork tenderloin,trimmed
- 1/2cuproasted salted pistachios
- 3tablespoonsDijon mustard
- 1roundedtablespoonminced garlic,or to taste
- 2teaspoonsmaple syrup
- 1/2teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/2teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1pinchcayenne pepper
- 2tablespoonspanko breadcrumbs
- 1tablespoonvegetable oil
- 2tablespoonsseasonedrice vinegar
- 1/2cupchicken broth
- 1tablespooncoldunsalted butter
- 1pinchsalt, or to taste
- chopped freshchives,for garnish (optional)
Instructions:
1. Place pork on a cutting board. Trim off any tough membrane, or “silver skin.” Butterfly the pork tenderloin by cutting lengthwise straight down the center, being careful to go only 75% of the way through. If pork is cut all the way to the cutting board, it will separate into 2 pieces and this recipe will not work.
2. Place butterflied pork on a piece of plastic wrap, and cover with another piece of plastic. Use a meat pounder to pound the pork to about 3/16-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
3. Coarsely chop pistachios and set aside.
4. In a small bowl, combine mustard, garlic, maple syrup, salt, black pepper, and cayenne, and mix thoroughly with a spoon until combined.
5. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
6. Remove pork from the refrigerator to a cutting board, one long side facing you. The pork will be an uneven shape at this point. To even it up more, slice a small piece off the pointed end, and place it over the gap on the wider end. Add a piece of plastic over the top, and pound with the meat pounder. The meat will adhere to itself, take on a more rectangular shape, and be easier to fill and roll evenly.
7. Spread mustard mixture evenly over the surface almost all the way to the edge on 3 sides, but leaving a couple inches of the edge furthest from you uncovered. Cover mustard evenly with breadcrumbs, and then with pistachios.
8. Roll pork up tightly, finishing with the seam at the bottom. Use kitchen string to tie pork every inch or so, trimming off any excess string.
9. Add vegetable oil to an oven-safe skillet, and set heat to medium-high. When oil is hot, add tied tenderloin and brown pork on all sides, turning often, about 4 minutes total.
10. Roast pork in the preheated oven in the skillet until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 16 to 20 minutes.
11. Remove skillet from the oven. Transfer pork onto a plate, loosely cover with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.
12. Meanwhile, for pan sauce, place skillet back on the stove over high heat; pour in rice wine vinegar and chicken broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, scraping bottom and sides of the pan with a spoon to help dissolve any caramelization.
13. Once about 75% of liquids have evaporated, and mixture is very slightly thickened, turn off heat and add cold butter. Keep butter moving by shaking the pan or stirring with a spoon until it disappears, and sauce is glossy and emulsified. Season with a pinch of salt and keep warm.
14. Snip the string off pork, then slice into about 1-inch thick pieces. Strain pan sauce over pork slices and garnish with fresh snipped chives to serve.John Mitzewich

3. Place skillet with bacon grease back over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour into skillet. Cook, without stirring, until eggs begin to set on the bottom and around the edges, about 20 seconds. Lift and fold partially cooked eggs so the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue to cook until fully set but still glossy and moist, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in bacon. Transfer to a plate to cool.
4. Stir white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl. Split biscuit dough portions in half horizontally to get 16 portions. Roll each out into a 4-inch circle. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture over each circle. Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons egg mixture into the center of each; top each with 1 cheese cube. Carefully wrap edges of dough around filling to enclose and seal. If needed, roll balls with hands to ensure dough is sealed.
5. Arrange balls, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Brush tops of balls with melted butter.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until deep golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack; let cool 15 minutes before serving.

3. Pinch 1 generous tablespoon of meat mixture and wrap around 1 cube of cheese. Roll to form a ball, then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Continue with remaining meat mixture and cheese.
4. Cut bacon slices in half widthwise, then cut each piece in half lengthwise, making 4 strips from each bacon slice.

- 1/8teaspoongarlic
- 8ouncestrip steak
- 3mozzarella pearls

Instructions:
1. Add olive oil, balsamic vinegar, herbs, and garlic to a resealable plastic bag. Pat the strip steak dry and add steak into the marinade. Reseal the bag; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
2. Brush grill grates with oil or grill spray. Preheat a gas grill with burners on High and lid closed for 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Remove steak from marinade, and allow excess to drip off; discard marinade. Place steak directly on grill grates over High heat. Sear with lid closed, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Rotate steak 45 degrees halfway through cooking on each side for crosshatch grill marks.
4. Move steak to indirect heat and cook to your preferred doneness, 1 to 2 minutes per side for a rare strip steak or 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove to a platter and keep warm.
5. Quarter mozzarella pearls and cherry tomatoes, and slice basil leaves into very thin strips. Place topping on steak and drizzle with balsamic glaze to serve.Cook’s NoteThe snack-size portions of mozzarella by Belgioso are the perfect size for the caprese topping.I do not recommend grilling the steak beyond medium rare. The balsamic vinegar in the marinade may go from caramelized to burned if cooked longer.

Category: vegetables
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/caramelized-zucchini-pasta-recipe-11784765
Ingredients:
- 3tablespoonsolive oil
- 4garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4teaspoonred pepper flakes
- 1 1/2poundszucchini, trimmed and grated on the large holes of a box grater
- salt and freshly cracked black pepperas needed
- 1poundcurly or tube-shapedpasta, such as fusilli or rigatoni
- 1/2cupgrated finely grated Parmesan cheese or Pecorinoplus more for serving
- 1tablespooncoldbutter(optional)
- lemon zest(optional)
- fresh basil(optional)
Instructions:
1. Gather all ingredients.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
2. Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet or heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat. When warm, add garlic and red pepper flakes and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add zucchini and season with 1 teaspoon salt and cracked black pepper. You may have to add zucchini in batches if it doesn't all fit in the pan.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
3. Stir every few minutes until zucchini is softened and liquid is drawn out of it, 5 to 10 minutes. Continue to cook until liquid is evaporated, and zucchini starts to brown, 10 to 15 minutes more.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta for 1 to 2 minutes less than the package states for al dente pasta. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain pasta; set aside.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
5. Turn heat under the skillet to medium-low, and stir zucchini frequently in the final 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. As zucchini caramelizes, it may start to stick to the bottom of the pan. You can loosen it by adding a little more olive oil or a few tablespoons of water; use a wooden spoon to release the browned bits (or fond) on the bottom of the pan. Zucchini is done when it starts to clump together, and looks darkened in color and slightly browned.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
6. Turn heat down to low and add pasta to the skillet along with about 1/2 cup pasta water; stir to combine. Add cheese slowly; stir and add pasta water as needed if it gets too thick. When cheese is well incorporated, add butter, and stir until glossy and smooth. Season with salt and pepper.Allrecipes / Qi Ai
7. Garnish with black pepper, more cheese, lemon zest, and chopped fresh basil.Allrecipes / Qi Ai

- 1/2teaspoonground ginger
- 1/4teaspoonground nutmeg
- 1/8teaspoonground cloves
- 1/8teaspoonground allspice
- 2largeeggs, at room temperature
Instructions:
1. Place half-and-half in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until mixture just begins to simmer, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often. Remove pan from heat and add in chai tea bags. Allow mixture to steep, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.
3. For crust, beat butter, white sugar, vanilla and salt together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and combined. Add in flour and beat on low speed until mixture comes together to form a soft dough. Press dough firmly and evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven and until crust looks just set, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool 5 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, for filling, in the same bowl you used for crust (no need to wipe out the bowl), beat together pumpkin, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, cardamom, salt, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice with an electric mixer until smooth and combined.
6. Remove tea bags from half-and-half mixture. Squeeze bags to remove as much moisture from them as possible; then discard tea bags. With the mixer running on low speed, gradually pour half-and-half mixture into pumpkin mixture; beat until all is thoroughly incorporated. Add in eggs and beat on low speed until just incorporated. Once crust has cooled for 5 minutes, pour filling evenly over the top.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until bars are puffed and there is only a slight jiggle in the center of the filling, 50 to 55 minutes. Allow bars to cool completely to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours to overnight.
8. Once bars have chilled, lift them out of the pan using the parchment overhang. Cut into 12 bars.
9. If desired, served topped with a lightly sweetened whipped cream and an extra sprinkle of cinnamon.

Title: Pissaladière (Southern French “Pizza”)
Category: vegetables
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/pissaladiere-southern-french-pizza-recipe-11787803
Ingredients:
- 1 1/4cupswater
- 1teaspoondry active "rapid rise" yeast
- 1tablespoonolive oil, plus more for greasing parchment
- 3cupsall-purpose flour
- 1 1/2teaspoonskosher salt
- 4ouncesolive oil-packed anchovy filets
- 2tablespoonsolive oil
- 4tablespoonsunsalted butter
- 5largeyellow onions- peeled, halved, and thinly sliced
- 1/2teaspoonkosher salt
- 6fresh thymesprigs
- 2tablespoonssherry vinegar
- 1/4teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 20pittedKalamata or Nicoiseolives, rinsed well, halved lengthwise
- finely chopped chives,for garnish (optional)
Instructions:
1. For dough, add water and yeast to a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes. Stir in olive oil, flour, and salt, and knead until a very sticky, elastic dough is formed, about 4 minutes. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
2. Punch down dough to remove the air bubbles, and transfer to a floured work surface. Form into a smooth ball of dough.
3. Grease a parchment paper sheet with olive oil; and transfer dough onto the sheet; grease another parchment sheet and lay it on top of the dough. Press out dough with your hands to form a rectangle, then switch to a rolling pin and roll dough out to cover nearly the entire surface of the paper.
4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Transfer dough with both sheets of parchment onto a sheet pan. Carefully peel off the top sheet of paper, and then use a fork to prick the dough all over.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove to cool on a rack; set aside until needed.
6. Transfer anchovies into a bowl and cover with 4 cups of cold water. Gently separate the fillets and let soak for 1 hour. Water may be changed halfway through to remove more salt from anchovies. Drain and pat dry on paper towels.
7. For caramelized onions, add butter and olive oil to a heavy-bottomed pot, and place over medium-high heat. Add onions and salt, and toss occasionally with a spatula, until onions just begin to slump down in the pot. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.
8. Uncover; reduce heat to medium low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are a light golden brown, about 1 hour. Add thyme, sherry vinegar, and black pepper. For a slightly more intense version, a few anchovy fillets can be added to the onions at this point. Cook, stirring, for another 10 to 15 minutes. Turn off heat and let cool.
9. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C).
10. Line a baking sheet with a fresh sheet of parchment, and grease with olive oil. Place crust on the prepared sheet. For a crispier edge, brush 1-inch of the outside edge of dough with olive oil. Spread caramelized onions over crust, going nearly to the edge.
11. Place half of the anchovies in diagonal rows, spaced a couple inches apart, on top of the onions, then place the other half of anchovies in diagonal rows in the other direction to form the classic pissaladiere decoration. Place an olive half inside each opening in the grid formed by anchovies.
12. Bake in the preheated oven until edges of the crust are browned, and the bottom is golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to ool for about 5 minutes. Cut in squares and serve.John MitzewichChef's NotePie crust dough or frozen puff pastry can also be used for this, following the same procedure.Fresh marinated anchovies, also known as boquerones, can also be used instead of olive oil-packed anchovies.

Ingredients:
- 6mini cucumbers
- 2teaspoonssalt
- 1/4cupchoppedred onions
- 1/4cupseasonedrice vinegar
- 3tablespoonshot honey,such as Mike’s Hot Honey®
- 2tablespoonssoy sauce
- 1teaspoonsesame oil
- 1teaspoonfish sauce
- 2clovesgarlic, minced
- 1/4teaspoonred pepper flakes, or to taste
Instructions:
1. To spiral the cukes, place one between 2 chopsticks, and cut down into thin straight slices on the top. Flip the cucumber and make cuts at a 45 degree angle (diagonally) on the other side. This procedure allows the cucumbers to fan. Be sure that with each cut, the knife is hitting the chopsticks, so you don’t cut all the way through. Repeat with remaining cukes.
2. Place spiraled cucumbers in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt, and gently rub salt in. Set aside to draw out moisture, but no longer than 10 minutes to avoid over softening. Rinse well with cold water to remove salt, and pat dry with a paper towel. Return to the bowl, and add onions.
3. For dressing, whisk vinegar, honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, fish sauce, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl until well combined. Pour dressing over cucumber-onion mixture, and gently toss until well coated.
4. Let cucumbers sit at room temperature for about 5 to 10 minutes, or cover and move to the fridge until ready to serve. Gently toss again before serving.

Title: Chai-Spiced Apple Babka
Category: fruits
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/chai-spiced-apple-babka-recipe-11791604
Ingredients:
- 1cupwhole milk
- 1/4cupsugar
- 1/4cupbutter
- 1teaspoonsalt
- 1/4cupwarmwater(110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)(43 degrees C to 46 degrees C)
- 2 (0.25-ounce)packages activedry yeast
- 2largeeggs
- 4 1/2cupsflour
- 8tablespoonsbutter
- 4mediumapples - peeled, thinly sliced, and cut into bite-sized pieces (about 4 cups)
- 2teaspoonslemon juice
- 2cupspackedbrown sugar
- 1/2cupflour
- 1tablespoonDIY Chai Spice (see footnote) or store-bought chai spice
- 1tablespoonvanilla extract
- 2largeegg whites, lightly beaten
Instructions:
1. Make Dough:Heat and stir milk, sugar, butter, and salt in a small saucepan just until warm (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F/43 degrees C to 46 degrees C) and butter is almost melted. Pour 1/4 cup warm water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Sprinkle yeast over warm water. Stir to dissolve. Stir remaining milk mixture into yeast mixture.
2. Add eggs and 2 1/2 cups flour to mixer bowl. Beat at low speed until combined. Beat at high speed for 15 seconds. Switch to dough hook attachment. Add remaining 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time. Mix until dough leaves sides of bowl, about 5 minutes. Transfer dough to a large, lightly greased bowl, turning dough to coat. Cover; let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Make Filling:Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add apples; cook, stirring frequently, until just beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice.
4. Melt 4 tablespoons butter. Transfer to a bowl. Stir in brown sugar, flour, chai spice, and vanilla (mixture will be crumbly). Stir in egg whites.
5. Shape Babka:Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto a large, lightly floured surface, cover with a bowl, and let rest 10 minutes. Line 3 (4x8-inch) loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on long sides.
6. Divide dough into thirds. Roll out each third into a 12-inch square on a lightly floured surface. Spoon one-third of the brown sugar filling (about 2/3 cup) onto each dough square and spread to 1/2 inch from edges. Evenly sprinkle one-third of the apple filling (about 1 heaping cup) over each dough square. Roll up each square tightly to form a log. Pinch seam closed to seal. With your palms, roll logs back and forth to make uniformly cylindrical.
7. With a sharp knife or dough scraper, cut one log in half lengthwise, exposing striped interior. Lay one half over the other, striped sides out, in an X. Twist ends below cross together 2 or 3 times. Repeat with ends above cross, twisting in opposite direction to form a spiral. Fit into prepared pan, patting down any loose filling and tucking ends under. (It might look like a mess now, but it comes out beautifully!) Repeat with remaining logs and pans. Cover pans with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
8. Bake Babka:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter; brush over loaf tops. Bake loaves until puffed, well-browned, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into centers registers 200 degrees F (93 degrees C), about 45 minutes, tenting with foil if tops get too brown before loaves are done. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then use parchment to lift loaves from pans to transfer to wire racks.
9. Cool completely on wire racks, about 1 hour, before slicing and serving. (To freeze babka, wrap tightly and freeze up to 2 months. Thaw at room temperature.)DIY Chai SpiceCombine 2 teaspoons ground cardamom; 1 teaspoon cinnamon; 1 teaspoon ground ginger; 1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds; 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves; and a dash of black pepper. (Store in an airtight container up to 6 months.)

Title: Prosciutto Melon Granita
Category: fruits
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/prosciutto-melon-granita-recipe-11793630
Ingredients:
- 3ouncesprosciutto
- 2poundsripe sweetmelon, any type
- 1/3cupwater
- 1/8teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/4cupplus 1 teaspoonwhite sugar, divided
- 2dropsgreen gelfood coloring, or as needed
Instructions:
1. Tear prosciutto into thin strips, and transfer into a dry nonstick sauté pan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until fat begins to render out and meat begins to brown slightly at the edges, just a few minutes. Remove 2/3 of prosciutto to a plate and reserve; this will be used later for the melon granita mixture.
2. Continue to cook the remaining 1/3 of meat until rendered further and edges begin to crisp, about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, transfer meat onto a paper towel-lined plate, and let cool. Chop into small pieces when cool enough to handle, and refrigerate until needed. Do not wipe any fat from the pan.
3. Scoop 2 pounds of ripe, sweet melon into a bowl. Transfer 8 ounces of melon from the bowl into a blender. Place the bowl with remaining melon into the refrigerator until needed.
4. Add reserved 2/3 portion of prosciutto into the blender. Add 1/3 cup of water, and blend until smooth.
5. Pour melon mixture into the same sauté pan you cooked prosciutto in; add a pinch of salt and 1/4 cup sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl, pour in melon mixture, and gently press out the liquid. Cool down to room temperature before proceeding, about 15 minutes. Refrigerate, if desired, for faster cooling.
6. Liquify remaining 1 1/2 pounds melon in the blender; add to the bowl with prosciutto-infused melon. Add a drop or two of green food coloring, and stir to combine.Chef's NoteThe final granita will be about half as dark in color as the liquid is before freezing. For a final light melon-green color, use enough food coloring to create at least a medium green liquid.
7. Pour melon mixture into a casserole dish. Ideally, liquid should be about 1/2-inch deep.
8. Transfer the casserole into the freezer, uncovered, until the outside edge begins to freeze, 30 to 45 minutes. Use a fork to mix the partially frozen portion into the liquid portion and stir to combine. Freeze for about 30 minutes, and repeat. Continue freezing and scraping with a fork as many times as it takes to create the texture of slightly wet snow. Cover and freeze until ready to serve.
9. For candied prosciutto bits, add reserved chopped prosciutto to a dry nonstick sauté pan over medium heat, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Cook, stirring, until sugar disappears, and prosciutto pieces become shiny. Transfer onto a plate and let cool. Prosciutto pieces should be crispy when cool.
10. To serve, use a fork to break up the granita into crystals, as fine or coarse as you like. Sprinkle  with candied prosciutto bits.John Mitzewich

- 1/4cupconfectioner's sugar,plus more for garnish
- 1teaspoonlemon zest
- 1largeegg white,lightly beaten
- 1quartvegetable oil for frying,or as needed
Instructions:
1. For dough, stir together flour, white sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Make a well in the center.
2. Add egg, Marsala, water, and vinegar to well. Mix with a fork until dough starts to come together. Transfer to a flour-dusted work surface; knead until dough forms a ball, about 10 minutes, adding 1 teaspoon water as needed. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight).
3. For apple filling, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add apples, brown sugar, apple pie spice, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft, about 15 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together lemon juice and cornstarch; add to apple mixture. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer cooled mixture to a pastry bag.
4. For ricotta filling, stir together drained ricotta and powdered sugar in a large bowl; fold in lemon zest. Transfer mixture to a pastry bag.
5. To shape and fry shells, divide dough into 2 balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 ball into a 16- to 18-inch circle, about 1/16 inch thick or less. Using a 4- to 5-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 12 circles. Dust circles with a light coating of flour. (This will help you later in removing shells from cannoli tube molds.) Roll each dough circle around a cannoli tube, sealing edges with a bit of egg white. Repeat with remaining dough ball.
6. Pour oil to a depth of 3 inches in a deep, heavy-bottomed 4-quart pot or deep fryer; heat to 375°F. (You’ll need about 1 quart oil.) Working in batches, fry shells on tubes, turning halfway through, until golden, about 1 minute. Using tongs, transfer shells to a wire rack lined with paper towels to drain.
7. Let stand just until tubes are cool enough to handle, then carefully twist each tube to remove shell. (Using a kitchen towel may help your grip.) Wash or wipe off tubes to use for remaining shells, if needed.
8. To assemble, pipe apple filling into shells, filling two-thirds full from center to one end and repeating on other side. Repeat piping method with ricotta filling. Garnish cannoli with powdered sugar.Draining RicottaTo drain ricotta, place a cheesecloth- lined fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Place ricotta in strainer, cover with plastic wrap, then place a heavy object (like an unopened 28-oz. can) on top. Put all components in the refrigerator and drain at least 8 hours (and up to 24 hours). Discard any liquid before using in Step 4.Cook’s NoteMake Ahead: Store unfilled shells in an airtight container up to 1 month. Chill apple and ricotta fillings in separate airtight containers up to 3 days. Fill shells no more than 1 hour before serving.From the EditorWe have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking.

URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/homemade-apple-jelly-recipe-11796470
Ingredients:
- 3 1/2poundsookingapples(such as Braeburn, Granny Smith, and/ or Rome Beauty
- 3cupswater
- 1cupapple juice,or up to 2 cups as needed
- 1(1.75 ounce) packageregular powderedfruit pectinor 6 tablespoons classic powdered fruit pectin (such as Ball®)
- 7 1/2cupswhite sugar
Instructions:
1. Remove stems and blossom ends from apples. Do not peel or core (peels and cores contain pectin and will be discarded later). Chop apples.
2. Combine apples and the water in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, covered, 10 minutes.
3. Place a colander lined with cheesecloth in a large bowl. Pour apple mixture into colander. Let drain, without pressing, until mixture stops dripping, 1 to 2 hours. Add enough apple juice to juice in bowl to reach 5 cups. (Discard solids.)Recipe TipFor the prettiest jelly, avoid pressing the solids in the colander, which can make cloudy jelly as the apples are draining.
4. Return juice to clean large pot. Whisk in pectin. Bring to a full rolling boil. Add sugar. Return to a full rolling boil. Boil hard 1 minute. If foam forms on surface, quickly glide a metal spoon over surface to skim off foam; discard.

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
2. Roll pie dough out on a work surface. Cut out 12 circles with a 4-inch round cookie cutter.
3. Gently press each circle into the cup of a standard muffin tin to form a mini pie shell. Pierce the bottom of each crust a few times with a fork.
4. Pre-bake empty shells in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Remove muffin tin from the oven and allow for the shells to cool for about 5 minutes.
5. Spoon cherry pie filling evenly into the shells. Roll out remaining pie dough and cut out 12 circles with a 3-inch round cookie cutter. Place on top of the pie filling and crimp the edges so filling is fully enclosed.
6. Slice dark cherries in half. Place one cherry half, cut-side down, in the center of each mini pie.
7. Cut out one large and one small crescent shape for the "eyelids" from the dough scraps. Gently place eyelids onto each cherry, pressing down lightly to secure them (leave about half of the cherry peaking out as seen in the photo). Repeat for all 12 "eyes".
8. Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl and brush pastry top and eye lids with the egg wash using a pastry brush.
9. Bake mini pies in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool pies in the tin for at least 10 minutes. Transfer cherry pies to a wire rack to cool completely.
10. Before serving, pipe a tiny dot on each cherry to create a "glint" in the eye with white icing. Pipe a thin line of white icing along the lower edge of each cherry. Drizzle red berry sauce on a plate to look like a pool of "blood". Set eyeball pie in the center of the plate and enjoy your spooky creation!Peyton BeckwithCook’s NoteTo make your own white icing, whisk 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar with a few drops of milk.

2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 16 (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups or line with paper bake cups.
3. Whisk together flour, apple pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together applesauce, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, and melted butter. Add flour mixture and stir just until combined (there should be some lumps). Stir in walnuts. Spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling cups two-thirds full.
5. For each rose, lay 8 to 10 apple ring halves in a 10-inch-long horizontal line, so they are overlapping by half with curved sides at top and core side facing bottom. Starting at one end, roll apples to form a rose shape. Place atop batter in a muffin cup, gently pressing into batter. Repeat with remaining apples.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into muffin (not apple rose topper) comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack 5 minutes. Remove from pan. Serve warm or cool completely. To store, chill in an airtight container up to 5 days.

Ingredients:
- 6ouncescranberries, fresh or frozen
- 1/4cupdarkmaple syrup
- 1/4cupwhitesugar
- 1/4cupwater
- 12ouncesfrozenberry mix
- 8ouncesfreshblackberries(optional)
- 8sliceswhite bread, crusts removed, or more as needed
- 1cupheavy cream
- 2tablespoonsdarkmaple syrup
- 1/4teaspoonground ginger
- 1pinchsalt
- pomegranate seeds,for garnish (optional)
Instructions:
1. Line a 7 to 8-inch pudding bowl with plastic wrap so there is overhang on all sides. Set aside.
2. Add cranberries, 1/4 cup maple syrup, sugar, and water to a saucepan, set over medium heat, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, then add frozen berries and blackberries. Keep the heat on low to medium until all the fruit is soft and you have lots of juice in the pan, about 10 minutes more.
3. Strain juice into a large bowl. Set fruit aside.
4. If you’re in a rush here and need the dessert to be ready in under 4 hours, check the footnotes  before the next step.
5. Dip 1 side of bread in fruit juices for 2 seconds and start lining the bowl with dipped slices, with some overlap, and the dipped side facing out.
6. Once the entire bowl is covered with bread - you don’t want any gaps! - pour in the fruit and cover the top of the bowl with a couple more dipped bread slices. Wrap the plastic wrap overhang over the top and place a plate with something heavy on top of the bowl. Place in the fridge for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours to set.
7. Just before serving, whip cream with 2 tablespoons maple syrup, ground ginger, and a pinch of salt. Turn the bowl out onto a serving dish, and use plastic wrap to ease the pudding  out of the dish. It should be a bright pink dome. Cut slices from the dome and serve with whipped cream, and any extra juice you have left. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds for garnish.Peyton BeckwithCook’s NoteIf you are hoping to chill for only 4 hours, dip both sides of the bread, 1 second each side.If you prefer a cinnamon whipped cream, just switch the ground ginger out for the same amount  of cinnamon.

Title: Cheese Agnolotti
Category: pasta
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/cheese-agnolotti-recipe-11694882
Ingredients:
- 2cupsall-purpose flour or "OO" flour
- 3largeeggs
- 12ouncesricotta cheese
- 1ouncegrated Parmesan cheese
- 1largeegg yolk
- 1/4cupfinely mincedItalian parsley
- 1teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/2teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1pinchcayenne pepper
Instructions:
1. Make a pile of flour on a work surface, and make a well in the center. Add eggs to the well, and scramble eggs with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from the edges. When the dough becomes too thick to use a fork, use a bench scraper to lift remaining dry flour over the top and begin to cut flour in until a shaggy dough forms.
2. Knead dough by hand until you have a smooth ball of dough, about 3 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Knead until a very smooth and elastic ball of dough forms, about 4 minutes more. Wrap tightly and rest dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
3. Add ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolk, parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne to a bowl, and stir together until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
4. Divide dough into 4 sections. Cover 3 sections with plastic, lightly flour a work surface, and shape the 4th into a rectangle. Use a rolling pin to roll dough into an 18x9-inch rectangle, thin enough to see your hand through.
5. Trim into 2 strips, approximately 18 by 4 1/2 inches. Maintain just enough flour on the work surface for this step and proceeding steps to prevent dough from sticking to the surface.
6. Transfer filling into a piping bag, or a plastic bag with 1 corner cut off, and pipe a 1/2-inch thick rope of filling lengthwise along each dough strip, 2 inches in from the edge. Mist each piece of dough very lightly with water.
7. Fold dough over filling, being careful not to trap any air bubbles. Press the 2 long edges of dough firmly together, flattening the seam to the thickness of a single layer of dough if possible. Use a fluted pasta cutter to trim excess dough to about 1/8-inch from the filling.
8. Starting at the end where the filling begins, and use two fingers to pinch the filling and dough together very tightly every inch to inch and a half. Bend the pressed sections of dough between the filling forward slightly. Use the pasta cutter to slice between each to form individual agnolotti. It may be helpful to mist the dough again before doing this step.
9. Transfer finished agnolotti to a lightly floured, parchment-lined pan. Cover and refrigerate until ready to cook. Agnolotti can also be frozen on the pan before being transferred into freezer bags for storage.
10. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook agnolotti for 3 minutes before transferring into the sauce of your choice.John Mitzewich

Title: Handkerchief Lasagna
Category: pasta
URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/handkerchief-lasagna-recipe-11709920
Ingredients:
- 2cupsall-purpose flour or "OO" flour
- 3largeeggs
- 12ouncesricotta cheese
- 1ounceParmesan cheese, grated
- 1largeegg yolk
- 1/4cupfinely mincedItalian parsley
- 1teaspoonkosher salt
- 1/2teaspoonfreshlyground black pepper
- 1pinchcayenne pepper
- 3cupspreparedmarinara sauce, or any other pasta sauce
- 6freshbasil leaves, torn
- 4ouncesmozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1/4cupgrated Parmesan cheese
Instructions:
1. Make a pile of flour on a work surface, and make a well in the center. Add eggs to the well, and scramble eggs with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from the edges. When the dough becomes too thick to use a fork, use a bench scraper to lift remaining dry flour over the top and begin to cut flour in until a shaggy dough forms.
2. Knead dough by hand until to form a smooth ball, about 3 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Knead until a very smooth and elastic ball of dough forms, about 4 minutes more. The dough recipe makes enough for 2 lasagnas; divide dough in half; wrap tightly and rest 1 piece of dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Freeze remaining dough for another use.
3. For cheese filling, add ricotta, Parmesan, egg yolk, parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne to a bowl, and stir together until evenly combined. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
5. Shape pasta dough with lightly floured hands into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Roll dough out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface into a large, very thin rectangle. The thinner and larger it is, the better. Turn dough over occasionally during rolling to prevent sticking, and dust with flour as needed. Use a pizza cutter to divide dough lengthwise down the center into 2 long strips.
6. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Slowly lower pasta strips into boiling salted water, and cook for 1 minute 30 seconds. Transfer dough into a bowl of cold water until cooled. Transfer onto work surface and cut each strip in half widthwise to make 4 pieces total.
7. Set aside about 1/2 cup of cheese mixture. Dollop the rest of cheese mixture by spoonfuls evenly over the 4 pasta pieces, and spread it out roughly but evenly. Spoon about 1/3 cup of pasta sauce onto each piece.
8. Top each piece of pasta with torn basil. Set aside 3/4 cup mozzarella; scatter the rest evenly over pasta. Fold each piece of pasta in half to form the stuffed handkerchiefs.
9. Spread a layer of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, and place the first handkerchief in the dish. Spread over 1/3 of reserved cheese mixture, followed by a few spoons of sauce, and another small scatter of shredded mozzarella. Repeat layering with remaining 3 handkerchiefs. Top with sauce, remaining mozzarella, and a dusting of Parmesan. Drizzle with olive oil.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is lightly golden brown and the pan is bubbling around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into quarters to serve.John Mitzewich

- 1tablespoonchili powder
- 2(15-ounce) canswhite kidney beans(cannellini beans), drained

- 1(15-ounce) canfire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1/2cupslicedpepperoncini peppers
- 1stickunsalted butter, sliced into 8 pieces
Instructions:
1. Place chicken thighs into a slow cooker. Sprinkle over the powdered au jus gravy mix, ranch dressing, and chili powder. Top with cannellinibeans, pepperoncini pepper brine, fire roasted diced tomatoes, sliced pepperoncini peppers, and butter.
2. Cover, and cook until chicken thighs are fork tender, on High for 3 to 4 hours or on Low for 6 to 8 hours.  During the cooking time, use tongs or a long spoon to stir and redistribute the ingredients every hour or so.
3. Once chicken is tender, transfer chicken thighs to a bowl. Use a pair of the kitchen scissors to cut chicken thighs into about 1-2-inch pieces. Transfer chicken thighs back into the chili in the slow cooker, and stir to combine. Reduce heat setting to warm mode, and taste for seasoning before serving.John MitzewichChef's NoteYou can use chicken breasts instead of thighs, but the thighs make for a better chili, and won’t dry out during the long cooking time.For a more pronounced chili flavor, you can double the amount of chili powder. For a spicier version, ground chipotle can be substituted for some of the chili powder.

Instructions:
1. Add pork to a large soup pot or Dutch oven. Add salt, honey, berries, lingonberry jam, and cold water, and turn the heat to high.
2. While stew is coming to a boil, add garlic, dry thyme, and ground coriander. When mixture comes to a rolling boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer gently for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Stir in onion, leeks, and mushrooms, and simmer until meat is almost, but not quite fork tender,  about 45 minutes more.
4. Stir in cabbage, carrots, and fennel; continue to simmer until vegetables and meat are very tender, about 30 minutes.
5. Season to taste with salt. Serve with fresh herbs scattered over the top.John MitzewichChef's Note:This stew can be made with any meat.For best results, purée the black berries, and pass through a strainer to catch the seeds before adding to the stew.Other root vegetables such as turnips, beets, and rutabagas were common ingredients used by the Vikings, and can all be added to this stew as well.
